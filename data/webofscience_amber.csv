This unique specimen, a well preserved female in Burmese amber from Myanmar, is described as Myanmariscus deboiseae gen. nov. sp. nov. It belongs to the clade Synocheta Legrand, 1946 based on the poorly differentiated flagellum of antenna, its small body size and underdeveloped eyes. Its familial position remains uncertain because this group is primarily classified using male reproductive structures. However, comparison with the biogeographical distribution of Recent species of Oniscidea suggests it most probably belongs to the Styloniscidae Vandel, 1952. This specimen and other records of Oniscidea in Cretaceous amber from East Europe indicate that this remarkable group of crustaceans was already highly diversified by the Cretaceous, thus supporting an earlier origin for the group.

In this study, we documented the characteristics of fossils hosted in the amber, and we present zircon U-Pb ages of tuff layers from the Kachin and Hkamti sites (i.e., the new mine). We also present a compilation of arthropod and echinoderm syn-inclusions from the mid-Cretaceous Hkamti amber of Myanmar, indicating a humid tropical or subtropical forest paleo-environment. Zircon analyses (n = 143) of four tuff samples that host the amber deposit in different pits yielded a weighted-mean age of 109.7 +/- 0.4 Ma. Zircon rare earth element data demonstrate the zircons are of igneous origin. Therefore, the age of the Cretaceous amber biota from Hkamti is ca. 110 Ma. This means that the Hkamti assemblage should be treated as distinct from other Burmese amber collections, as it represents a significantly older source within a different depositional environment. The commercial sources of Burmese amber are variable and encompass multiple mining regions, which makes maintaining distinctions between deposits important if their faunal contents are to be studied in a proper temporal or ecological context. The refined understanding of amber deposits in Myanmar highlights the importance of distinguishing sources, but it also offers an opportunity to study a series of deposits from similar to 110 to similar to 72 Ma, instead of just one snapshot of terrestrial ecology around similar to 99 Ma.","[Xing, Lida] China Univ Geosci, State Key Lab Biogeol & Environm Geol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Xing, Lida; Qiu, Liang] China Univ Geosci, Sch Earth Sci & Resources, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Qiu, Liang] Univ Nevada, Dept Geosci, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA","Qiu, L (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, Sch Earth Sci & Resources, State Key Lab Geol Proc & Mineral Resources, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",qiul@cugb.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41888101, 41790455, 41772008, 41702207]; National Geographic Society (USA)National Geographic Society [EC0768-15]","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants 41888101, 41790455, 41772008, and 41702207), and National Geographic Society (USA; Grant EC0768-15).

Eoceniretes Kirejtshuk and Nel, 2008 was first described from a fossil embedded in the lower Eocene Oise amber (France). This new species, Eoceniretes antiquus sp. nov., exhibits sexual dimorphism; males have a long and modified scapes. Although male mechanical modifications are usually understood to play a role in intrasexual competition, in this case the modified scapes is hypothesized to fulfill some function for sexual communication rather than for fighting. The syninclusions of many specimens from the same species demonstrate that this group of beetles, which today form large aggregations as larval and adult stages to feed on angiosperm flowers, had this aggregation behavior as early as the mid Cretaceous. Kachin Myanmar amber (98.79 +/- .62 Ma) was deposited during an intense diversification of angiosperms (also called Cretaceous Terrestrial Revolution), and so we postulate that Kateretidae were a possible pollinators for the basal angiosperms, an inference based upon their aggregative and pollination behavior in the extant species.

A collection of Burmite (Burmese amber) from the Hukawng Valley, Myanmar at the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, Chinese Academy of Sciences was examined, revealing that Burmite inclusions contain a very highly diverse hymenopteran fauna with as many as ten families found new for the Burmese fossil assemblage. The mid-Cretaceous hymenopteran fauna of Burmese amber is revised at the family level. A high level of the first family occurrences and endemism is demonstrated suggestive of an insular syndrome affected the mid-Cretaceous Burmese biome, as well as somewhat contradictory features in composition of the hymenopteran families there.

This study reviewed the odonatans in lowermost Cenomanian Kachin amber and commented 11 odonatans, which were previously placed in the family level. Until now, over 350 odonatans have been found in Kachin amber, including 38 species of three extant suborders, and representing the most diverse and abundant dragonfly assemblage in amber inclusions. The dominated odonatans include the damselflies Burmahemiphlebia zhangi and Mesomegaloprepus magnificus, and the damsel-dragonfly Burmaphlebia reifi, accounting for ca. 79% of all odonatans. The Kachin odonatans include the earliest records of the damselfly Perilestidae, Platycnemididae and Platystictidae, and the youngest records of the true dragonfly Araripegomphidae and Stenophlebiidae, contributing to exploring the origination and evolution of these families. Hemiphlebiidae is the dominant family in Kachin amber, represented by the species Burmahemiphlebia zhangi with ca. 160 species been recorded. It is surprising that the hemiphlebiid damselfly is abundant, but the diversity is very low with only two species been previously reported. Herein, a new hemiphlebiid damselfly, Kachinhemiphlebia lini gen. et sp. nov., is described by the unique characters: Arc slightly distal of Ax2 in both foreand hindwings; and a well-defined AA ending on posterior wing margin below Ax2.

The snail, a probable juvenile, is preserved in Burmese amber (Burmite) from Myanmar, of earliest Cenomanian age. Morphological evidence suggests a cyclophoroidean ancestry and a possible attribution to the family Cyclophoridae: members of this superfamily are widespread today in Asia, thus indicating a long geological history in the region.

Fossil ticks are very rare. Those from Burmese amber are the oldest examples of Ixodida recorded so far, and this is also the first time that this specific interaction between ticks and spiders has been documented in the fossil record. Spiders occasionally prey on ticks in modern ecosystems. However, those families which have been recorded catching ticks today lack a convincing Mesozoic fossil record and it is difficult to identify the producer of the fossil silk with any certainty. It is also possible that the tick was not part of the spider's usual prey spectrum, but accidentally entered the web and was subjected to immobilization wrapping as an initial precautionary attack.

The new taxon shares some primitive traits with other Mesozoic schizopterids, but also derived a series of autapomorphic characteristics. The two Mesozoic schizopterid genera Hexaphlebia and Lumatibialis, which have not been assigned to subfamily level, are tentatively treated as early representatives of Hypselosomatinae based on their complex tegminal venation similar to that of the genus Hypselosoma. Additionally, a key to all known fossil species of Schizopteridae is provided on the basis of tegminal features. Our findings further confirm Schizopteridae as one of the basal clades of Dipsocoromorpha, being highly diversified and widespread by the late Mesozoic. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Additionally, a new genus and species of Mimarachnidae, Mimaeurypterus burmiticus gen. et sp. nov., from the same Burmese (Myanmar) amber, is herein described. Mimaeurypterus gen. nov. can be distinguished from other mimarachnids by its large body size, mesonotum with median carinae not reaching anterior margin, msoscutellum without distinct wrinkles, and broad, coriaceoustegmina with apical margin truncate. The new discovery further confirms that this extinct hemipteran group was diverse and had high morphological disparity during the late Mesozoic. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

This is the first record of a male copulatory organ of this nature preserved in amber and is of special importance due to the age of the deposit. The penis has a slender, distally flattened truncus, a spatulate heart-shaped glans and a short distal stylus, twisted at the tip. In living harvestmen, the penis yields crucial characters for their systematics. Male genital morphology in H. grimaldii appears to be unique among the wider Dyspnoi clade to which this fossil belongs. The large eyes in the fossil differ markedly from other members of the subfamily Ortholasmatinae to which H. grimaldii was originally referred. Based on recent data, it has been argued that large eyes may be plesiomorphic for Palpatores (i.e. the suborders Eupnoi and Dyspnoi), potentially rendering this character plesiomorphic for the fossil too. Thus, the unique structure of the penis seen here, and the probable lack of diaphanous teeth, present in all other extant non-acropsopilionid Dyspnoi, suggest that H. grimaldii represents a new, extinct family of large-eyed dyspnoid harvestmen, Halithersidae fam. nov.; a higher taxon in amber diagnosed here on both somatic and genital characters.","[Dunlop, Jason A.] Leibniz Inst Evolut & Biodivers Sci, Museum Nat Kunde, Invalidenstr 43, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Selden, Paul A.] Univ Kansas, Dept Geol, 1475 Jayhawk Blvd, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Selden, Paul A.] Univ Kansas, Inst Paleontol, 1475 Jayhawk Blvd, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Selden, Paul A.] Nat Hist Museum, Dept Earth Sci, Cromwell Rd, London SW7 5BD, England; [Giribet, Gonzalo] Harvard Univ, Museum Comparat Zool, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, 26 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA","Dunlop, JA (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Evolut & Biodivers Sci, Museum Nat Kunde, Invalidenstr 43, D-10115 Berlin, Germany.",jason.dunlop@mfn-berlin.de,"Selden, Paul/C-7530-2009; Giribet, Gonzalo/P-1086-2015; Dunlop, Jason A./AAC-8042-2019","Selden, Paul/0000-0001-7454-4260; Giribet, Gonzalo/0000-0002-5467-8429; ",,,,23,5,6,0,3,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0028-1042,1432-1904,,SCI NAT-HEIDELBERG,Sci.

This is particularly the case for one of the more basal lineages, the superfamily Chthonioidea, which are common and diverse in leaf litter habitats across the world but have only been described in the fossil record from some specimens in Baltic, Dominican and Chiapas ambers. Here, we describe and illustrate the oldest pseudoscorpion of the superfamily Chthonioidea from the mid-Cretaceous (lowermost Cenomanian, ca. 99 Mya) amber of northern Myanmar and extend the known fossil record of this diverse superfamily from the Eocene into the Cretaceous. Fragments that suggest a diverse pseudoscorpion fauna have been recorded in Myanmar (Burmese) amber but this is only the fourth pseudoscorpion fossil described from this ancient amber type. The single adult female specimen is substantially older than the next oldest fossil chthonioids, which were described from Baltic amber (ca. 44-49 Mya), and displays small but significant differences to other chthonioids, such that we describe a new genus and species, Weygoldtiella plausus gen. et sp. nov. The placement of the trichobothria on the chelal hand suggests it can be attributed to the family Chthoniidae, but important morphological features are obscured in the fossil which obfuscates hypotheses regarding its nearest relatives. The specimen, although imperfectly preserved, has no known Recent relatives in this area or elsewhere in the diverse chthonioid fauna, and may represent an extinct lineage. Overall, this fossil is another example of the diverse arachnid community preserved in Burmese amber that includes lineages that are now extinct here and of considerable biogeographic interest, e.g. ricinuleids, and fauna which is essentially modern, e.g. solifuges.

The amber mines are located on the West Burma Block that according to geologists was originally part of Gondwana. The present study introduces some angiosperms and insects in Burmese amber whose closest extant relatives have a Gondwanan distribution and there is no previous evidence of a Laurasian distribution. Based on this evidence, it is proposed that organisms in Burmese amber represent a selection of tropical to subtropical life forms that inhabited the interconnected continents of Gondwana in the Early Cretaceous. Based on the fossil record of angiosperms and their diversity in Burmese amber, the West Burma Block could not have rafted from Gondwana to SE Asia before the Early Cretaceous.","[Poinar, George, Jr.] Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Poinar, G (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",poinarg@science.oregonstate.edu,,,,,,59,50,60,1,10,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0891-2963,1029-2381,,HIST BIOL,Hist.

In this paper, the three-dimensional fluorescence spectra were adopted to explore the spectral characteristics of Burmese amber, which served as the object of study. The results showed that for Burmese golden amber and brown amber, which emit glaringly bluish-white fluorescence under longwave ultraviolet radiation, there was a fluorescence peak in the three-dimensional fluorescence spectra, the scope of the peak was about lambda(ex)350 similar to 400 nm/lambda(ex)400 similar to 450 nm, and the main fluorescence peakwas positioned at lambda(ex)360 nm/lambda(em)425 nm, with high fluorescence intensity. For the Burmese blood amber, which glows in earthy yellowish fluorescence under long-wave ultraviolet, its fluorescence peaks were located at about lambda(ex)420 similar to 520 nm/lambda(em)500-580 nm, and the fluorescence peaks were scattered in multiple small peaks, with weak fluorescence intensity. Heating the golden amber and brown amber samples under oxidizing conditions produced baked blood amber, and it was found by comparing its three-dimensional fluorescence spectra before and after baking that fluorescence peaks of the baked blood amber, compared with those before baking, were red-shifted, from lambda(ex)480 similar to 530 nm/lambda(em)520 similar to 570 nm, with extremely weak fluorescence intensity, which was consistent with the fluorescence characteristics of the natural blood amber. The infrared absorption spectrum demonstrated that oxidation caused the concentration of oxygen-containing groups such as carbonyl C=O in the molecular structure of blood amber and baked blood amber to increase. As a strong chromophore group, Carbonyl C=O made amber in a red appearance with its increased concentration and absorption intensity. Meanwhile, as an electron with drawing substituent, Carbonyl C=O replaced the H atom in the molecular structure and linked with the impurity atom with no bonding, producing n -> pi(1)* transition, making the fluorescence intensity of amber weakened, and even quenched, as well as facilitating the fluorescence peaks to shiftin the long wavelength direction. The Three-dimensional fluorescence spectra can present the fluorescence phenomena of Burmese amber in a fast and effective manner, and provides a new analysis tool for the study of amber's fluorescence characteristics and molecular structure.","[Bai Ying; Zheng Xiao-hua; Yin Zuo-wei] China Univ Geosci, Gemol Inst, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China; [Zheng Xiao-hua] West Yunnan Univ Appl Sci, Sch Jewelry, Tengchong 679100, Peoples R China","Yin, ZW (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, Gemol Inst, Wuhan 430074, Peoples R China.",gicbaiying@163.com; yinzuowei1025@163.com,,,,,,6,1,2,6,7,OFFICE SPECTROSCOPY & SPECTRAL ANALYSIS,BEIJING,"NO 76 COLLAGE SOUTH RD BEIJING, BEIJING 100081, PEOPLES R CHINA",1000-0593,,,SPECTROSC SPECT ANAL,Spectrosc.

It is also the first fossil known within the superfamily Epedanoidea; a relatively derived Glade of Laniatores restricted to Southeast Asia today. At ca. 99 Ma, this new amber inclusion is substantially older than the previous oldest record of a member of Laniatores from Baltic amber (ca. 44-49 Ma); however, given the Palaeozoic age of Laniatores implied by molecular data, the new record from Burmese amber is probably still too young for constraining or calibrating the date of cladogenesis for total group Laniatores. Nevertheless, it provides a much better constraint for Epedanoidea, adding the first useful laniatorean fossil to provide an internal calibration point for a Glade of Grassatores.

It shares characters with Karschiidae, the subfamily Gylippinae among the Gylippidae and the subfamily Dinorhaxinae containing a single, monotypic genus Dinorhax Simon, 1879 in the family Melanoblossiidae; the latter genus occurring in South-East Asia today.

The individuals of F. xiai show a considerable variation in length/width ratio of both the crown and the tegmen as well as tegminal cell patterns, but they are assigned to the same species since a similar intra-specific variation has been well documented in Mesozoic Cercopoidea.

Its crown with distinct epicranial suture and anterior arms, and its frons with a median ocellus are similar to those of the Middle to Late Jurassic sinoalids from northeastern China, resembling the basal model of Clypeata.

It is undoubtedly placed in extant subfamily Malthininae based on its small-sized body, somewhat abbreviated elytra and fusiform terminal maxillary palpomere, representing the oldest documented occurrence of Malthininae. It suggests that this subfamily is an ancient group, which originated at least in the earliest Late Cretaceous. Our discovery sheds light on the palaeodiversity of Cantharidae in the Late Mesozoic. Together with other previously reported fossil cantharids, it is likely that Malthininae has been fairly diverse during the early evolution of Cantharidae. On the other hand, a morphological similarity between Archaeomalthodes and Recent malthinines and the occurrence of flowering plants in the Burmese amber implies a potential flower-visiting behaviour of this fossil species.

Earliest fossils of Frullaniaceae are known from mid-Cretaceous Burmese and Alaskan ambers. So far, evidence for four or five fossil species have been recovered in these ambers. The steady search for new fossils is important, since many liverwort fossils lack important characters and sometimes only the investigation of numerous specimens can provide all relevant characters. Based on two newly discovered and exquisitely preserved gametophytes from mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber, we provide a detailed investigation and re-appraisal of two previously described species of Frullaniaceae, namely Frullania baerlocheri and Protofrullania cornigera. The new discovery of a complete gametophyte of F. baerlocheri with both vegetative and fertile parts enables an emended morphological description, and demonstrates that F. baerlocheri and F. pinnata are conspecific. A new specimen of P. cornigera provides additional information concerning leaf lobule, stylus and leaf cells. The fossil record and phylogenetic analysis of the liverworts recovered in mid-Cretaceous Burmese and Alaskan amber clearly show that Frullaniaceae have already accumulated some notable diversity in the Cretaceous, including the extant genus Frullania with three species and the extinct monotypic genus Protofrullania from mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber and probably also the extinct monotypic genus Kaolakia from mid-Cretaceous Alaskan amber.

The new phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that S. birmaniasis and the Messel specimen can be placed in the subfamily Eubrianacinae. The structure of the gills and functional spiracles indicates that the respiration system of the larvae of S. birmaniasis was well-developed. Specifically, their medial suture is well-developed, which might be a plesiomorphic character. Evolutionary relationships and biogeographical distribution patterns are discussed, the evidence supports a general dispersal trend from Southeast Asia to Europe. Furthermore, S. birmaniasis provides new insights into the taphonomy of similar organisms, in this process a huge amount of resin and fast embedding of specimens are important factors.

Antennal and mouthpart structure suggest the female of this fossil species was a vertebrate blood feeder. The age of Burmese amber has been estimated as between Upper Albian to Turonian, 100-90 million years ago but the origins of the Culicidae are likely significantly older. The sister group of the Culicidae are the Chaoboridae, known as Jurassic fossils, and the Culicidae therefore must be equally as old.

Another order with potentially old origins is the short-tailed whipscorpions, or schizomids (Arachnida: Schizomida). These animals have a fragmentary fossil record with species either described or documented from Dominican amber (Miocene: Chattian), drill core sediments from the Oligocene in China, and the upper Pliocene (Zanclean) of Arizona. Here, we describe the first named example of a short-tailed whipscorpion from Upper Cretaceous amber (Myanmar: Hukawng Valley) based on male morphological features. Mesozomus groehni gen. et sp. n. cannot be assigned to any Recent genera of schizomids and preserves a unique mix of plesiomorphic (e.g. the retention of eyes) and apomorphic characters (e.g. enlarged femur IV) that merit future evaluation within a phylogenetic context.

Nanophemera is the fifth genus known in the Australiphemeridae (a Pangaean, Cretaceous family), which is hypothesized to represent a primitive group of small-sized, tusked, burrowing mayflies (Scapphodonta)., possibly closely related to the extant family Potamanthidae. Nanophemera is among the smallest known burrowing mayflies at slightly over four millimeters in length, and it differs from related genera by details of its cubital and anal venation systems in the forewings.

Based on the presence of a pair of pronotal callosities, Cretoboganium can be firmly placed in the extant subfamily Boganiinae, a small group currently comprising two small austral genera. Our discovery represents the first fossil record for Boganiinae. It also demonstrates another example that an apparently austral group may have its sister group occurred in today's northern hemisphere. Together with the other fossil boganiid known from the Middle Jurassic of China, the finding suggests that Boganiidae is an ancient and relict group. Moreover, the present biogeographic distribution of Boganiinae is indicative of an earlier origin of this subfamily, which likely originated before the breakup of the Gondwanan supercontinent.

The fossil can be placed in the extant genus Cyclaxyra of Cyclaxyridae, based on its morphological similarities to the extant species, especially the single pair of large deep foveae located at the anterior half of the elytral epipleuron. The discovery of Cyclaxyra cretacea sp. nov. in Burmese amber suggests that the New Zealand endemic family Cyclaxyridae originated before mid-Cretaceous, and was once much more widely distributed than it is in the present.

Based on the Burmese specimens, we suggest instead that the most parsimonious explanation for the past and present distribution of the family is to assume that Rotoitidae is an ancient lineage of Chalcidoidea that was originally widespread in suitable habitats across both Laurasia and Gondwana and later became extinct everywhere except Chile and New Zealand where the two extant genera occur.","[Huber, John T.] Canadian Natl Collect Insects, Nat Resources Canada, KW Neatby Bldg,960 Carling Ave, Ottawa, ON K1A 0C6, Canada; [Shih, Chungkun; Ren, Dong] Capital Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, 105 Xisanhuanheilu, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China; [Shih, Chungkun] Smithsonian Inst, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Dept Paleobiol, Washington, DC 20013 USA","Huber, JT (corresponding author), Canadian Natl Collect Insects, Nat Resources Canada, KW Neatby Bldg,960 Carling Ave, Ottawa, ON K1A 0C6, Canada.",john.huber2@canada.ca,,,,,,13,2,2,0,2,PENSOFT PUBLISHERS,SOFIA,"12 PROF GEORGI ZLATARSKI ST, SOFIA, 1700, BULGARIA",1070-9428,1314-2607,,J HYMENOPT RES,J.

Here, a remarkable new genus and species, Propiestus archaicus gen. et sp. nov., is described based on a well-preserved individual in Upper Cretaceous Burmese amber from northern Myanmar (Cenomanian, c. 99 Ma). It represents the first piestine fossil found in Mesozoic amber. The fine morphological characters preserved as an amber inclusion enable a confident systematic placement within the subfamily based on both our detailed observations and phylogenetic analyses. The resulting trees revealed a strongly supported sister-group relationship with the extant genus Piestus, comprising all currently known piestine species from the Neotropical region and one from the Nearctic. Our new discovery is congruent with a hypothesis of the Gondwanan affinity of insects found from Burmese amber. Considering the geological data as well as several previous studies, the current distribution of Piestus could possibly be explained by either a relictual Gondwanan distribution or the widespread presence of the clade Propiestus + Piestus on Pangea, rather than subsequent dispersal events during the Cenozoic. Nonetheless, more evidence is needed to corroborate the true biogeographical origin and past distribution of this clade. In agreement with strong external similarities with living Piestinae, Propiestus probably exhibits a specialized body plan, including a flattened body, long, slender antennae and short legs, suggesting that it inhabited microhabitats under the bark of rotting wood as do its modern congeners.","[Yamamoto, Shuhei] Field Museum Nat Hist, Integrat Res Ctr, 1400 S Lake Shore Dr, Chicago, IL 60605 USA; [Yamamoto, Shuhei] Kyushu Univ Museum, Hakozaki 6-10-1, Fukuoka, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan; [Caron, Edilson; Bortoluzzi, Sidnei] Univ Fed Parana, Biodivers Dept, Rua Pioneiro 2153, BR-85950000 Palotina, PR, Brazil","Yamamoto, S (corresponding author), Field Museum Nat Hist, Integrat Res Ctr, 1400 S Lake Shore Dr, Chicago, IL 60605 USA.; Yamamoto, S (corresponding author), Kyushu Univ Museum, Hakozaki 6-10-1, Fukuoka, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan.",s.yamamoto.64@gmail.com,"Yamamoto, Shuhei/U-8247-2018","Yamamoto, Shuhei/0000-0002-4162-8457; Caron, Edilson/0000-0001-7136-2218","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS, Tokyo, Japan) Overseas Research FellowshipMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [29-212]","We are very grateful to Adam Brunke (Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Ottawa, Canada) for checking the English language of the manuscript.

Here we describe and illustrate the first Mesozoic brachypsectrid, Vetubrachypsectra burmitica gen. et sp. nov., based on a male adult entombed in the mid-Cretaceous amber from northern Myanmar, approximately 99 million years ago. Vetubrachypsectra has a close affinity to the extant Brachypsectra, but primitively retains many plesiomorphic characters, including long antennae, tibial spurs 2-2-2 and male parameres without hook. Our discovery of a new Mesozoic brachypsectrid species pushes back the fossil record of Brachypsectridae by approximately 55 million years, which has great significance for further dating of phylogenetic trees of beetles.

It belongs to the extant Pelecotominae and represents the second documented occurrence of this subfamily in the Late Cretaceous. This new taxon is morphologically distinguishable in Pelecotominae by the combination of following characters: eyes oval, without incision; antennomeres V-X serrate, with XI fusiform; maxillary palpi unmodified; protarsi shorter than protibiae; tibiae sparsely provided with spines; tibial spurs formula 2-0-2. Together with other previously reported fossil ripiphorids, it highlights the species diversification of wedge-shaped beetles during their early evolution. On the other hand, a morphological similarity between Spinotoma and modern pelecotomines and the occurrence of xylophagous beetles in the Burmese amber suggest a similar host preference in wood-boring beetles for this species, shedding lights on an ancient host-parasitoid relationship in the late Mesozoic. This paper also provides a brief discussion on the taxonomy and evolution of Mesozoic wedge-shaped beetles. The wedged-shaped body form and fully-developed elytra in Recent Pelecotominae and Ptilophorinae are considered to be derived from their early ancestors rather than evolved with the onset of flowering plants during the Cretaceous as commonly thought.

Thyrsopteris cretacea is the first described mid-Cretaceous tree fern preserved in amber. It adds to the diversity previously ascribed to the Thyrsopteridaceae, which has been based on Eocene fossils, and it extends the fossil record of the family further back to the mid-Cretaceous.

The fossil, which is described as Paleotriatoma metaxytaxa gen. et sp. nov., contains a predominance of features of the Triatominae as well as some characters of the Reduviinae and is considered an intermediate fossil representing an early progenitor of the Triatominae. Based on the present distribution of the Triatominae and recent studies indicating that Burmese amber fossils could have originated in Gondwana, it is proposed that Paleotriatoma metaxytaxa is a Gondwanan lineage that evolved in the mid-Cretaceous.

Although the infrared spectra of these ambers present similar features for ambers from different locations, refined differences in location and intensity of absorption peaks could be identified among them. Between 3 000 and 2 800 cm(-1), two obvious bands with a weak shoulder peak are seen in the Baltic amber spectrum, whereas there are two bands in the Dominica's and three bands in the Myanmar's. In region of 1 740 similar to 1 690 cm(-1), one band appears at 1 732 cm(-1) in the spectra of the Baltic amber sample, distinctly different from those of the Dominican and Myanmar ambers which have a doublet at 1 730 and 1 695 cm(-1). For the Dominican amber, the intensity of 1 730 cm(-1) is much stronger than that of 1 695 cm(-1), being contrary to the spectra of the Myanmar amber, whose intensity of 1 730 cm(-1) is weaker than that of 1 695 cm(-1). Within region of 1 300 1 000 cm(-1), Baltic amber can be distinguished from other two origin ambers by a horizontal shoulder, often called Baltic shoulder, with a definite band at 1 163 cm(-1). Spectra of the Dominican amber show a unique band at 1 240 cm(-1), while spectra of the Myanmar amber have a triplet at 1 224, 1 130 or 1 154 cm(-1) and 1 033 cm(-1), like wave of mountain altogether. Ratios of absorption intensity of 1 381 vs. 1 456 cm(-1) are about 0. 9, 0. 8 and 0. 7 respectively for the Baltic, Dominican and Myanmar ambers. These differences of absorption spectra could be used as the identifiable characteristics corresponding to the ambers locality. The correlation between the ambers' infrared spectra and localities is probably due to their age, plant provenance and geological environment indivadually. On the basis of presence and intensity of the bands attributed to exocyclic methylene groups, it is suggested that the Myanmar amber formed earliest, followed by Baltic and then the youngest Dominican. These finding reveals that infrared spectroscopy may have significance for identifing amber locality, and thus potentially have archeological implications in determining source of some ancient ambers.","[Wang Yan; Shi Guang-hai; Wu Rui-hua] China Univ Geosci, State Key Lab Geol Proc & Mineral Resources, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Shi Wei; Wu Rui-hua] Beijing CUG Gem Testing Ctr, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China","Shi, GH (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, State Key Lab Geol Proc & Mineral Resources, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",wyan1221@gmail.com; shigh@cugb.edu.cn,"Shi, Guanghai/AAJ-7206-2020","Shi, Guanghai/0000-0003-0089-3745",,,,11,4,4,0,28,OFFICE SPECTROSCOPY & SPECTRAL ANALYSIS,BEIJING,"NO 76 COLLAGE SOUTH RD BEIJING, BEIJING 100081, PEOPLES R CHINA",1000-0593,,,SPECTROSC SPECT ANAL,Spectrosc.

Despite their considerable age, very few fossils of the family have been reported - all of them in amber (Miocene Dominican, Miocene Mexican, and mid-Cretaceous Burmese ambers). Here we report a new mid-Cretaceous rhopalosomatid wasp, Cretolixon alatum Lohrmann, gen. et sp. nov., from Burmese (Kachin) amber. This new genus has a unique mixture of characters, some of which are only known from the recent brachypterous genus Olixon and others of which are known only from the recent macropterous genera. Thus, Cretolixon Lohrmann, gen. nov. not only provides further evidence for the monophyly of the family but also contributes evidence for the monophyly of the Rhopalosomatinae. Key characters of the family are discussed, and an updated checklist of the world genera and fossil species and occurrences of Rhopalosomatidae is provided. Additionally, a chemical analysis was performed for three of the newly reported fossils as well as for the amber piece containing the rhopalosomatid larva described by Lohrmann and Engel (2017) to ascertain their amber vs. copal nature and their affinities with each other and previously described Burmese amber.","[Lohrmann, Volker] Ubersee Museum Bremen, Bahnhofspl 13, D-28195 Bremen, Germany; [Lohrmann, Volker] Leibniz Inst Evolut & Biodiversitatsforsch, Museum Nat Kunde, Invalidenstr 43, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Zhang, Qi] Qufu Normal Univ, Sch Geog & Tourism, Rizhao 276826, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qi] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Michalik, Peter] Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Zool Inst & Museum, Loitzer Str 26, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany; [Blaschke, Jeremy] Union Univ, Dept Biol, 1050 Union Univ Dr, Jackson, TN 38305 USA; [Muller, Patrick] Univ Hamburg, Amber Study Grp, Geol Paleontol Museum, Bundesstr 55, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Jeanneau, Laurent; Perrichot, Vincent] Univ Rennes, CNRS, Geosci Rennes, UMR 6118, F-35000 Rennes, France","Lohrmann, V (corresponding author), Ubersee Museum Bremen, Bahnhofspl 13, D-28195 Bremen, Germany.; Lohrmann, V (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Evolut & Biodiversitatsforsch, Museum Nat Kunde, Invalidenstr 43, D-10115 Berlin, Germany.",v.lohrmann@uebersee-museum.de,"Lohrmann, Volker/AAB-4489-2020","Lohrmann, Volker/0000-0003-0476-7041",Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes; grant OSUR from program AO2 2018; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB26000000]; Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research [2019QZKK0706],"Financial support in the initial and final stage of this project was provided by the Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes (to Volker Lohrmann), grant OSUR from program AO2 2018 for visiting researchers (to Vincent Perrichot, enabling Volker Lohrmann's work at the University of Rennes 1) and by the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDB26000000) and the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (2019QZKK0706; both to BoWang and enabling the purchase of the NIGP specimen studied herein and Vincent Perrichot's work at NIGP, respectively).",,66,0,1,1,1,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",2193-0066,1860-1014,,FOSS REC,Foss.

Marine fossils are extremely rare in Cretaceous and Cenozoic ambers. Here, we report a record of an ammonite with marine gastropods, intertidal isopods, and diverse terrestrial arthropods as syninclusions in mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber. We used X-ray-microcomputed tomography (CT) to obtain high-resolution 3D images of the ammonite, including its sutures, which are diagnostically important for ammonites. The ammonite is a juvenile Puzosia (Bhimaites) and provides supporting evidence for a Late Albian-Early Cenomanian age of the amber. There is a diverse assemblage (at least 40 individuals) of arthropods in this amber sample from both terrestrial and marine habitats, including Isopoda, Acari (mites), Araneae (spiders), Diplopoda (millipedes), and representatives of the insect orders Blattodea (cockroaches), Coleoptera (beetles), Diptera (true flies), and Hymenoptera (wasps). The incomplete preservation and lack of soft body of the ammonite and marine gastropods suggest that they were dead and underwent abrasion on the seashore before entombment. It is most likely that the resin fell to the beach from coastal trees, picking up terrestrial arthropods and beach shells and, exceptionally, surviving the high-energy beach environment to be preserved as amber. Our findings not only represent a record of an ammonite in amber but also provide insights into the taphonomy of amber and the paleoecology of Cretaceous amber forests.","[Yu, Tingting; Kelly, Richard; Mu, Lin; Zhang, Haichun; Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Yu, Tingting; Zhang, Haichun; Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Yu, Tingting] Univ Sci & Technol China, Sch Earth & Space Sci, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Kelly, Richard] Univ Bristol, Sch Earth Sci, Bristol BS8 1TQ, Avon, England; [Kelly, Richard; Ross, Andrew] Natl Museum Scotland, Dept Nat Sci, Edinburgh EH1 1JF, Midlothian, Scotland; [Kennedy, Jim] Univ Oxford, Museum Nat Hist, Oxford OX1 3PW, England; [Kennedy, Jim] Univ Oxford, Dept Earth Sci, Oxford OX1 3AN, England; [Xia, Fangyuan] Lingpoge Amber Museum, Shanghai 201108, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Dilcher, David] Indiana Univ, Dept Geol & Atmospher Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA","Wang, B (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Wang, B (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, CAS Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Wang, B (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.; Dilcher, D (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Geol & Atmospher Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",bowang@nigpas.ac.cn; dilcher@indiana.edu,,"Dilcher, David/0000-0001-7226-6703; Thomson, Ulysses/0000-0001-7517-6674","Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research [2019QZKK0706]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB26000000, XDA19050101]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41622201, 41688103]","We are grateful to A.

Here, we describe a bizarre armoured planthopper nymph: Spinonympha shcherbakovi gen. et sp. nov. from mid-Cretaceous Kachin amber. The new genus and species is characterized by its large size, armoured body, extremely long rostrum, and leg structure. The fossil nymph cannot be attributed to any known planthopper family, but can be excluded from many families due to its large size and leg structure. The armoured body was probably developed for defence, and the extremely long rostrum indicates that, in the past, planthopper feeding on trees with thick and rough bark was more widespread than today. The new find reveals a new armoured morphotype previously unknown in planthopper nymphs. The fossil record of adult planthoppers is comparatively rich, but nymphs are rare and not well studied. Here, we describe a bizarre armoured planthopper nymph, Spinonympha shcherbakovi gen. et sp. nov., in mid-Cretaceous Kachin amber. The new genus is characterized by its large size, body armed with spines and tubercles, extremely long rostrum reaching well beyond the apex of the abdomen; profemur and mesofemur subcylindrical, covered with setae; protibia and mesotibia subquadrangular, densely covered with setae; protarsus and mesotarsus with two segments, tarsomere II longer and wider than I; metatrochanter swollen, metafemur subcylindrical, covered with short setae; metatibia subquadrangular, densely covered with short setae, without lateral spine and pectens without setae; metatarsus with three segments, and metatarsomere III extremely small. The fossil nymph cannot be attributed to any known planthopper family, but can be excluded from many families due to its large size and leg structure. The armoured body was probably developed for defence, and the extremely long rostrum indicates that, in the past, feeding on trees with thick and rough bark was more widespread than today. These features indicate that the new specimen represents a new armoured morphotype of planthopper nymph from the fossil record.","[Luo, Cihang; Wang, Bo; Jarzembowski, Edmund A.] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Luo, Cihang; Wang, Bo; Jarzembowski, Edmund A.] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Luo, Cihang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Luo, CH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China.; Luo, CH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China.; Luo, CH (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",chluo@nigpas.ac.cn; bowang@nigpas.ac.cn; jarzembowski2@live.co.uk,,"Luo, Cihang/0000-0002-4855-6185",Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB26000000]; Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research [2019QZKK0706]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41688103]; Chinese Academy of Sciences' President's International Fellowship Initiative (PIFI); Leverhulme FellowshipLeverhulme Trust [IGCP 679],"This research was funded by the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDB26000000), the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (2019QZKK0706), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41688103) and the Chinese Academy of Sciences' President's International Fellowship Initiative (PIFI).

Both groups have a particularly scarce geological record and arc known since the Cretaceous: them am only four species of webspinners known from Burmese amber, and only two sclerogibbids were described from Barremian Lebanese and Cenomanian Burmese ambers. Here we report transferred genus from Aptian Choshi (Japan) amber and new sclerogibbids from Cenomanian Burmese and Charentese (France) ambers. The taxa described from Burmese amber are: Burrnascterogibba apt era gen. el sp. nov., Cretoscterogibba gen. nov. (with C. antennalis sp. nov., C. contractocollis sp. nov., C. neli sp. nov. and C. rasnitsyni sp. nov.) and Edrossia vetusta gen. et sp. nov. The first European fossil sclerogibbid Gallosclerogibba alnensis gen. et sp. nov. is described from Charentese amber. The holotype of Chosia yamadai Fujiyama, from Choshi amber, is re-described; it appears to be the oldest Laurasian sclerogibbid. The significant abundance and variety of Burmese sclerogibbid wasps (60% of fossil species known worldwide), as proxy of their hosts, were probably caused by the protection granted to them by the silk webs and possibly by the limited predation from omithuromorph birds or crown-group ants. While all three extant sclerogibbid genera have apterous females, genera with winged females (Creto.sclerogibba and Edrossia) dominated in Burmese amber. Small silk galleries from hosts may have favored the preservation of wings in females of Cretaceous sclerogibbids. Most new species described in the present paper, in addition to C. yamadai, are characterized by a very slender neck and a very long frontal process concealing the antennal toruli. These characters disappeared in extant species. We suggest that this loss was caused by a change in the fauna of predators, penalizing species with long neck and rostrum.

Highly specialized features of Zigrasimecia include extensive development of the clypeal comb, a thick brush of setae on the oral surface of the mandibles and on the labrum, and a head that is broad, flattened, and which bears a crown of blackened, rugose cuticle. Mouthparts are hypothesized to have functioned in a unique manner, showing no clear signs of dentition representative of chewing or otherwise processing solid food. Although all ants in Burmese amber are basal, stem-group taxa, there is an unexpected diversity of mouthpart morphologies and probable feeding modes.","[Barden, Phillip] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, New York, NY 10024 USA; Amer Museum Nat Hist, Richard Gilder Grad Sch, New York, NY 10024 USA","Barden, P (corresponding author), Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, New York, NY 10024 USA.",pbarden@amnh.org; grimaldi@amnh.org,,"Barden, Phillip/0000-0001-6277-320X",National Science Foundation PredoctoralNational Science Foundation (NSF); Richard Gilder Graduate School fellowships; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [0850543] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"We are grateful for the loan of the unique specimen by James Zigras, and for his continued generosity in loaning specimens from his collection; to Brian Fisher for insight into clypeal and labral setae structures; Steve Thurston, for assistance with figures; and two anonymous reviewers for valuable feedback.

Additionally, all legs carry a prominent lanceolate lobe on the third tarsomere. A similar structure is found, but organized differently, in Recent Orussidae and Stephanidae, serving as part of a vibration analyser. Although sharing some characters with families Karatavitidae, Orussidae and Paroryssidae, this new taxon cannot be assigned to any of these families.

Burmese amber is the oldest Lagerstatte where both diverse webspinners and sclerogibbids are found. In this paper, Sclerogibba cretacica sp. nov. is described from Late Cretaceous Burmese (Myanmar) amber. The new species, assigned to the extant genus Sclerogibba Riggio & De Stefani-Perez, 1888, is the fourth known fossil species of Sclerogibbidae and the first known fossil male of this family. Moreover, this is the first described sclerogibbid wasp from Burmese amber and the first known fossil species of Sclerogibba. Sclerogibba cretacica is similar to extant sclerogibbid wasps with a closed discoidal cell from South-East Asia, but differs in the shape of the discoidal cell and small number of antennomeres (19 only).

The extant family Platystictidae is one of the most diverse Zygoptera, but short of fossil records. In this paper, a new species, Mesosticta davidattenboroughi sp. nov., is described from mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber, representing the third-known fossil species of Platystictidae. Mesosticta davidattenboroughi sp. nov. has a long IR1 beginning one cell distal of the base of RP2, confirming the previous attribution of Mesosticta Huang, Azar, Cai & Nel, 2015 to Platystictidae. It differs from other species of Mesosticta in having a long IR1 and a basally crossed subdiscoidal cell. The fossil genus Mesosticta shares the diagnostic characters of the modern platystictid genera, viz. a basally recessed 'CuP' (shared by all species), a very long IR1 (only in Mesosticta davidattenboroughi sp. nov.), and a specialized subdiscoidal area mostly rhomboidal in shape (only in Mesosticta electronica Zheng, Zhang, Chang & Wang, 2016). Based on the platystictid damselflies from Burmese amber, a new subfamily Mesostictinae subfam. nov. is established. Mesostictinae subfam. nov. represents the first fossil group of modern platystictid damselflies, documenting the appearance of Platystictidae as early as mid-Cretaceous. It differs from modern Platystictidae by the presence of fewer postnodal and postsubnodal crossveins, a short MP, the base of RP2 being nearer to the subnodus and the nodus lying more distally.","[Zheng, Daran; Wang, Bo; Jarzembowski, Edmund A.; Zhang, Haichun] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Daran; Chang, Su-Chin] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Earth Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, 1 Beichen West Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Nel, Andre] UPMC, Sorbonne Univ, Museum Natl Hist Nat,UMR 7205,Entomol, CNRS,MNHN,EPHE,ISYEB,Inst Systemat Evolut Biodive, 57 Rue Cuvier,CP 50, F-75005 Paris, France; [Jarzembowski, Edmund A.] Nat Hist Museum, Dept Earth Sci, London SW7 5BD, England","Zheng, DR (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Zheng, DR; Chang, SC (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Dept Earth Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",dranzheng@gmail.com; suchin@hku.hk,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41572010, 41622201, 41688103]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [2011224]; HKU Seed Funding Program for Basic ResearchUniversity of Hong Kong [201210159058]","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers 41572010, 41622201, 41688103), Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (grant number2011224), and the HKU Seed Funding Program for Basic Research (grant number 201210159058).

For a better understanding of the timing and pattern of millipede evolution, Burmese amber offers a unique window into the Cretaceous period, ca. 99 Ma. Here, we describe the first known fossil of the colobognathan order Platydesmida, the species Andrognathus burmiticus n. sp. based on 15 specimens from Cretaceous Burmese amber. We combine classical light-microscopy and modern micro-computer tomography (mu CT) with computer aided 3D-reconstructions. These non-invasive techniques allow us to describe the fossil millipedes as detailed as is general practice for extant species, and to grant the scientific community open access to the deposited Cybertypes. Based on the combination of unique morphological characters such as surface structures, body type, the unique size and shape of tergite 5, the absence of a hypoproct at the anal segment, and detailed gonopod characteristics, the studied fossils can be placed in the family Andrognathidae and the extant genus Andrognathus, which nowadays is restricted to the eastern USA and Mexico with three extant species. Therefore, the minimum age of the genus Andrognathus is pushed to the Cenomanian, 99 Ma. It can be assumed that the genus was much more diverse and wider distributed in the past and migrated between Asia and America via one of the once existing land bridges. These unique fossils prove the unusual relictual distribution of Andrognathus and can serve as key-fossils for the dating of the diplopod phylogeny.","[Moritz, Leif; Wesener, Thomas] Leibniz Inst Anim Biodivers, Zool Res Museum Alexander Koenig ZFMK, Adenauerallee 160, D-53113 Bonn, Germany","Moritz, L (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Anim Biodivers, Zool Res Museum Alexander Koenig ZFMK, Adenauerallee 160, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",moritz.leif@gmail.com,"Moritz, Leif/AAF-9547-2020","Moritz, Leif/0000-0002-6028-5189",Alexander Koenig Stiftung (AKS),"We want to express our gratitude to Patrick Muller for the opportunity to work on his unique collection of millipedes in Burmese amber and for the donation of several valuable specimens to the collection of the Zoological Research Museum A.

It exhibits many defining features of the extant Dasycerinae (e.g., acuminate maxillary palpomere 4, verticiliate and clubbed antennae, striate and carinate elytra, separated mesocoxae, and 3-segmented tarsi), but retains probably plesiomorphic traits, including short, comparatively compact antennae, greatly shortened elytra, and well-developed hind wings. The discovery reinforces the hypothesis that the Dasycerinae is a subfamily of Staphylinidae, closely related to Neophoninae, Protopselaphinae and Pselaphinae.

However, fossil evidence to corroborate this remains exceedingly rare. Burmese amber is an important source of new information on the radiation of derived fern lineages during the Cretaceous Terrestrial Revolution. This study describes Heinrichsia cheilanthoides gen. et sp. nov., a fern with suggested affinities to Pteridaceae, based on fertile foliage portions preserved in Early Cretaceous (similar to 100 Ma) amber from Myanmar. Heinrichsia cheilanthoides is characterized by a pinnate-pinnatifid frond that bears apical, marginal sori protected by a pseudoindusium. Sporangia are of the polypod type and contain tetrahedral-globose, trilete spores with a striate perine. This discovery provides a new calibration point to test and refine molecular clock-based concepts of the evolutionary history of the Pteridaceae. Heinrichsia cheilanthoides further substantiates the suggestion that the Cretaceous forests of Myanmar were home to a rich fern flora.","[Regalado, Ledis] Inst Ecol & Systemat, Varona 11835, Havana 11900, Cuba; [Schmidt, Alexander R.] Univ Gottingen, Dept Geobiol, Goldschmidtstr 3, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Mueller, Patrick] Univ Hamburg, Geol Palaeontol Museum CeNak, Amber Study Grp, Bundesstr 55, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Niedermeier, Lisa] Tech Univ Munich, Sch Life Sci, Alte Akad 8, D-85354 Freising Weihenstephan, Germany; [Krings, Michael] SNSB Bavarian State Collect Palaeontol & Geol, Richard Wagner Str 10, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Krings, Michael] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Earth & Environm Sci, Richard Wagner Str 10, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Schneider, Harald] Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, Ctr Integrat Conservat, Menglun 666303, Yunnan, Peoples R China","Regalado, L (corresponding author), Inst Ecol & Systemat, Varona 11835, Havana 11900, Cuba.",ledisregalado75@gmail.com,"Krings, Michael/AAM-6436-2020; Schneider, Harald/B-6681-2008","Schneider, Harald/0000-0002-4548-7268",,,,72,4,4,0,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1674-4918,1759-6831,,J SYST EVOL,J.

Manipulator modificaputis gen. et sp. n. is a morphologically unique extinct cockroach that represents the first (of a total of 29 known worldwide) cockroach family reported exclusively from the Myanmar amber. This family represents an early side branch of the stem group of Mantodea (most probably a sister group of Eadiidae within Blattaria/Corydioidea) because it has some synapomorphies with the Mantodea (including the stem group and Eadiidae). This family also retains symplesiomorphies that exclude a position in the crown group, and furthermore has unique autapomorphies that exclude a position as a direct ancestor of Mantodea. The unique adaptations such as strongly elongated extremities and freely movable head on a long neck suggest that these animals were pursuit predators.

Isolitaphis prolatantennus Poinar, 2017 (Isolitaphidae) from the same deposit was also included in this phylogenetic analysis due to the similarities between two families. Two main Glades within Juraphididae are recognized from our cladistic analysis: Prolavexillaphis Liu, Yao and Qiao gen. nov. and Isolitaphis (Poinar, 2017) form a monophyletic lineage; Aphaorus (Wegierek, 1991), Pterotella (Wegierek, 1991), Juraphis (Shaposhnikov, 1979) form a monophyletic lineage. These results indicate that Isolitaphis (Poinar, 2017) belongs to Juraphididae.

Ptinidae is one of these groups. We describe herein Cretasernus spinosus gen. et sp. nov. (Coleoptera: Ptinidae) based on one fossil specimen, the only known specimen of this family from Kachin amber (mid-Cretaceous of Myanmar). The holotype was imaged using an X-ray micro-CT system to obtain high-quality 3D images to complement the structures visualized using optical microscopes. The new species shows two autapomorphic characters never described in any extant or extinct species in this family: a groove near the base of the 11th antennomere, which makes it appear as a much smaller additional antennomere, and transverse metacoxae touching at the middle. Phylogenetic analysis of the new species clearly supports this new genus as part of Anobiidae sensu stricto (i.e. excluding the spider beetles) despite antennae that are certainly more similar to those seen in the many of the spider beetles (except for the modified 11th antennomere). Some of the extant species in this family are wood-borers and the involvement of beetles in resin production during the Cretaceous is a hypothesis that is suggested often. However, some ideas against the involvement of Ptinidae in resin production within the mid-Cretaceous forests of Myanmar are discussed.","[Peris, David; Bao, Tong; Maehler, Bastian] Rheinische Friedrich Wilhelms Univ Bonn, Inst Geowissensch & Meteorol, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Bao, Tong] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Bao, Tong] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Palaeoenvironm, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Philips, T.

The nymphid Araripenymphes seldeni, from the Crato Formation, is redescribed on the basis of a new specimen, showing possible sexual dimorphism in wing coloration, a feature extremely rare among the Neuroptera. In a recently published phylogenetic analysis of the family, the attribution to the fossil taxa (versus rejection) of the larval characters proper to the modern nymphids, has a crucial impact on the resolution of the phylogeny. The compression fossils currently attributed to the Nymphidae should be revised because their wing venation alone is not really sufficient for an accurate family attribution to Nymphidae rather than to another family of Neuroptera (viz.

Although it has been reassigned and redescribed several times, critical characters for a reliable placement of the species remain elusive. Here we provide detailed morphological characters of P. burmiticus on the basis of six well-preserved adults (five males, one female) and nine juveniles. The species has many similarities to extant species in many aspects, including the number of ommatidia, the number and arrangement of sensory trichomes, morphology and arrangements of body trichomes, and features of the trunk appendages.

However, there is a gap in the Mesozoic, with only slightly more than a dozen fossils being known, until the much more recent fossil records mainly from Cenozoic Dominican and Baltic ambers become available. Burmese amber, precisely dated to the Late Cretaceous, is known for an apparently rich but still undescribed millipede fauna, and might represent the ideal bridge to close this gap in the millipede fossil record. In addition, modern micro-computed tomography (mu CT) technology allows complex 3D reconstructions of objects fossilized in amber. Here we utilize mu CT technology to describe the first millipedes from Burmese amber, which are also the first two fossil representatives of the order Siphoniulida. Siphoniulida, with two known species and just nine recorded specimens, are the rarest and least known of the 16 extant orders of the Diplopoda. Records are known from Sumatra, Guatemala and Mexico. The two new fossils described here represent two distinct species, Siphoniulus muelleri sp. nov. and S. preciosus sp. nov., and indicate a wider distribution of this order in the Cretaceous. The holotype of S. muelleri sp. nov. was well enough preserved so that characters of the head, such as the incisura lateralis, not investigated before in extant representatives of the order, could be studied. This study highlights the possibilities and challenges provided by mu CT technology in investigating Diplopoda fossilized in amber. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Their dilarid affinities are supported by two autapomorphies of the family: the reduction of the ligula and the presence of pectinate antennae in males. They are considered to belong to two new subfamilies, Cretanallachiinae subfam. nov. and Cretadilarinae subfam. nov., respectively. These subfamilies are easily distinguished from other dilarids (Dilarinae, Nallachiinae, and Berothellinae) by possessing siphonate mouthparts; however they strongly differ from each other. In particular, the broad gonocoxites 9 of Cretanallachiinae females are not fused to form a distinct ovipositor, and bear long gonostyli, whereas a distinct saber-like ovipositor (short, lacking gonostyli) is present in Cretadilarinae. It is assumed that Cretanallachiinae primarily fed on pollen and Cretadilarinae on the nectar of flowers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent estimated ages vary from Albian to Cenomanian, based on palynology, an arnmonoid, and Mesozoic insect taxa preserved within the amber. The burmite-bearing rock is sedimentary and consists mainly of rounded lithic clasts (0.03 similar to 0.15 mm in diameter), with minor fragments of quartz and feldspar. Among the lithic clasts are mostly volcanic rocks. Zircons separated from the amber matrix form two groups: Group-1 zircons are overgrown and have variable CL patterns, experienced slight geological disturbances after they formed, and their Ion microprobe Pb-206/U-238 ages fall into a very narrow range of similar to 102 Ma- similar to 108 Ma; Group-II zircons are typical magmatic ones with rhythmically flat zones, inferred to be derived from volcanic rock clasts, and yielded a concordia Pb-206/U-238 age of 98.79 +/- 0.62 Ma. The dating on Group-1 zircons is only for their interiors, thus hiding what age excursion might come from the overgrowth. Considering the nearshore marine environment and 1-m thickness of the burmite-bearing sediments, and the syn- and post-eruption deposition of volcanic clasts, the age of 98.79 +/- 0.62 Ma therefore can be used as a maximum limit for the burmite (either at or after), establishing an earliest Cenomanian age for the fossilized inclusions. The age also indicates that volcanic eruption occurred at 98.79 +/- 0.62 Ma in the vicinity of the Hukawng Valley. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Genus Gnethoda Cui and Engel, gen. nov., is assigned to a new subfamily, Gnethodinae Cui and Engel, subfam. nov., based on its simplified medial system, unlike all other clothodids. However, the polarity of this character needs to be clarified by expanded cladistic analyses of the order in future studies.

Ceratomyrmex planes sp. nov. is the second species formally known for the genus and obliges a revision of the generic diagnosis. It can be recognized by its smaller size, the straight and shorter club-like cephalic horn, and flattened eyes. Haidomyrmex davidbowiei sp. nov. has only two trigger hairs on the apex of a brief clypeal lobe dorsal to the setal patch, the first flagellomere distinctly longer than the second, amongst other characters. Dilobops bidentata gen. et sp. nov., is the only known ant with a bidentate projection on the frontal region. Its clypeus is posteriorly flanked by two projecting lobes. The possible relation of the cephalic and mandibular morphology with the feeding habits of Haidomyrmecinae is discussed. It is argued that not all species impaled prey with their mandibles and that honeydew collection could have formed a part of their diet. A key for identifying the species of Haidomyrmex is included.

Mymarommatoids were first described as fossils, and although their extant 12 species are distributed worldwide, little is known about their biology. They seem to be absent from the tropics presently, and only two species in two families of Mymarommatoidea are known from the tropical mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber.

The fossil is unique in the superfamily and in the whole order Hymenoptera in totally lacking the hind wings. The complete loss of the hind wings in an actively flying insect is rare.

This is the first tachyporine rove beetle from Burmese amber and the oldest record of the subfamily in amber. The evolution of sexual dimorphism in the genital segments is briefly discussed.

Cretosynstrophus archaicus gen. et sp. nov. is confidently placed in the extant subfamily Eustrophinae based on its elongate oval body and pronotum with two basal, sublinear impressions. It shares several characters belonging to two Recent tribes (Eustrophini and Holostrophini), but it cannot be attributed to either of them. Together with other tetratomid genera from the Cretaceous, the new discovery implies that the Recent small family Tetratomidae is much more diverse and more widespread than previously documented. In addition, a morphological similarity between Cretosynstrophus and extant Synstrophus suggests a similar fungi feeding habit for Cretosynstrophus, highlighting an ancient association between tetratomid beetles and fungi in the Mesozoic.

The new discovery indicates antiquity of the genus Sarothrias and the family Jacobsoniidae, suggesting that the family probably originated before the breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, consistent with the hypothesis that the crown-group Staphylinoidea (including Jacobsoniidae) appeared about 193 million years ago.

It also provides firm evidence that gekkotans and possibly gekkonids were in Asia at this time. The Myanmar specimen shows, that the distinctive foot proportions and sophisticated adhesive mechanism, involving pads on the toes with transverse lamellae probably bearing numerous hair-like setae found in many modern geckos, had already evolved around 100My ago. The specimen is very small, even compared with juveniles of the smallest living geckos.

A new species, Hybosorus ocampoi Bai et Zhang sp. nov., of Hybosoridae (Scarabaeoidea) is described and illustrated based on one well-preserved Myanmar amber specimen. The phylogenetic position of H. ocampoi was analyzed by employing 117 morphological characters and 44 extant/extinct species. The documented features are discussed and analyzed with respect to the phylogenetic placement of the species which may have a strong impact on the evolution in Hybosoridae and greatly expand our knowledge on the early evolution of Scarabaeoidea. Our finding provides solid evidence to prove the very old origin of the genus Hybosorus which is the type genus of Hybosoridae. Furthermore, this finding not only supports the hypothesis of Mesozoic origin of most families in Scarabaeoidea but also supports some genera of Scarabaeoidea might have already appeared in the Mesozoic. The palaeobiogeography of Hybosoridae and its palaeoenvironmental implications are also discussed.","[Bai, Ming; Yang, Xingke] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, 92 Box,1 Beichen West Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Weiwei] POB 4680, Chongqing 400015, Peoples R China; [Ren, Dong; Shih, Chungkun] Capital Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Beijing 100037, Peoples R China","Yang, XK (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, 92 Box,1 Beichen West Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",baim@ioz.ac.cn; 241019017@qq.com; rendong@mail.cnu.edu.cn; chungkun.shih@gmail.com; yangxk@ioz.ac.cn,,,"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)National Basic Research Program of China [2011CB302102]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31172143, 31230065]; National Science Fund for Fostering Talents in Basic Research [NSFC-J0630964/J0109, J1210002]; Special Fiscal Funds of Shaanxi Province [2013-19]; Humboldt Fellowship from Alexander von Humboldt Foundation; Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in UniversityProgram for Changjiang Scholars & Innovative Research Team in University (PCSIRT) [IRT13081]","This research was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program) (No. 2011CB302102), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 31172143, 31230065), the National Science Fund for Fostering Talents in Basic Research (Special Subjects in Animal Taxonomy, NSFC-J0630964/J0109, J1210002), Special Fiscal Funds of Shaanxi Province (No. 2013-19), and by a Humboldt Fellowship (M.B.) from Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University (IRT13081).",,52,9,15,1,10,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1439-6092,1618-1077,,ORG DIVERS EVOL,Org.

We herein report a new true hopper family Minlagerrontidae Chen, Szwedo and Wang fam. nov. with two new species (Minlagerron griphos Chen, Szwedo and Wang gen. et sp. nov. and Minlagerron onyxos Chen, Szwedo and Wang gen. et sp. nov.) in mid-Cretaceous Machin amber from northern Myanmar. The new family, tentatively attributed to Hylicelloidea (Clypeata), shares a series of plesiomorphies with ancient Clypeata, and also bears some extremely unusual or even grotesque morphological characteristics, never recorded in other Clypeata, Hemiptera, or even all fossil and living insects. This family possesses a greatly specialized head with tylus extremely broad, compound eyes produced, postclypeus almost transversely rectangular in the middle, with basal half having a deep longitudinal groove medially, and rostrum stout. The anterior part of minlagerrontid prothorax is sharply constricted, forming a unique 'neck' and 'shoulder' structures, and the prothoracic legs are also highly modified with strengthened femora with several lateral teeth and tibiae deviantly club-shaped. The female pygofer of the new family is completely wrapped by tergite VIII and its ovipositor is short and reduced. Additionally, minlagerrontids possess unique tegmina with C5 almost closed, surrounded by terminal branches of CuA, and thick venation reticular with multiple ambient veins ending at anterior margin and crossveins it and rp-mp diploid. The new highly specialized family erected herein suggests that in the Mesozoic, to reduce mutual competition, ancient Clypeata had diversified multi-dimensionally and so possibly evolved with high disparity to occupy a wide range of ecotypes.

Here, we report on three ostracod specimens, that came visible as syninclusions to an aquatic isopod. The three specimens represent three different taxa, that were found preserved in a single piece of amber. One of the described specimens was studied using mCT scanning data. On the basis of general carapace morphology we assign all three to the group Podocopida, and (tentatively) its ingroup Cypridocopina. A lack of visibility of more particular diagnostic features such as adductor muscle scars and details of the marginal zone precludes a further identification, but we discuss possible affinities with either the marine-brackish group Pontocypridoidea or the non-marine group Cypridoidea. The taphonomy indicates that the studied ostracods had been subject to limited (if any) post-mortem transport, which could be consistent with marginal marine environments.","[Wang, He] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Wang, He] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, Nanjing, Peoples R China; [Schaedel, Mario] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Biol 2, Zoomorphol Grp, Planegg Martinsried, Germany; [Sames, Benjamin] Univ Vienna, Dept Geodynam & Sedimentol, Vienna, Austria; [Horne, David J.] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Geog, London, England","Wang, H (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing, Peoples R China.; Wang, H (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, Nanjing, Peoples R China.",hwang@nigpas.ac.cn,,,Austrian Science Fund (FWF)Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P 27687-N29]; Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [DFG Ha 6300/3-2]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB26000000],"This work was supported by Austrian Science Fund (FWF) project P 27687-N29, the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG Ha 6300/3-2) and the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDB26000000).

Re-investigation of the holotype of Vetiplanaxis pyrrhobryoides from the same amber deposit allows for a revision of the current taxonomic treatment as a putative member of Rhizogoniales, and tentatively supports the original interpretation as a member of Hypnodendrales. Three further fossils are described as new species Vetiplanaxis espinosus. Vetiplanaxis longiacuminatus, and Venplanaxis oblongus.

Flabellotoma heidiae gen. et sp. nov. is the Mesozoic representative of the putatively primitive subfamily Pelecotominae, represented by an almost completely preserved male. The new genus is compared with all extant members of the subfamily and is most notably distinguishable by an autapomorphic combination of a reduced tibial spur formula and unique ventral abdominal sclerite, and presumably in antennal structure as well. In addition, a syninclusion of eight males of Ripidiinae is discussed. The males are similar to Paleoripiphorus deploegi Perrichot, Nel, et Neraudeau in roughly coeval amber from western France. The syninclusion is interpreted as a result of aggregative behaviour during the flight activity of males, thereby representing the earliest documented evidence of such ethology.

Furthermore, distinctive morphological characters of C. patrickmuelleri with significant phylogenetic relevance are discussed. The general morphology, particularly that of the larva, has changed little between the Mesozoic and Cenozoic, and it reflects an evolutionary stasis that might correspond to their aquatic larval life-style.

Although the wing venation is identical to the majority of extant Hyptiogastrinae (Gasteruptiidae), phylogenetic analysis places H. electrinus as sister taxon to the Aulacidae s.str., (i.e. Aulacus + Pristaulacus). Thus, Hyptiogastrinae is confirmed as having a restricted Southern Hemisphere distribution (i.e. Australasia and South America). Consistent-with this result, H. electrinus is included within a slightly more broadly defined Aulacidae rather than being placed in a new monotypic family.

Interestingly, at least ten different fossil species have been described from inclusions in Upper Cretaceous Burmese amber. This suggests the family has been diversifying in the region for at least-100 million years. In this paper, we revise the taxonomy of fossil species of this family and the closely related Ochyroceratidae, based on the reexamination of type specimens of described species. We find that ten Cretaceous species described in the psilodercid genera Priscaleclercera and Aculeatosoma are valid, and present new illustrations of their type material. The genus Propterpsiloderces apparently does not belong to Psilodercidae, but rather to a family representing a stem lineage within Scytodoidea. Ochyroceratidae is represented in the fossil record by a single ochyroceratine genus from Miocene Dominican amber, Arachnolithulus. The original combination of the extant species Leclercera spinata Deeleman-Reinhold, 1995 is reinstated by transferring it from Priscaleclercera, leaving this latter genus as a strictly fossil taxon. Finally, we present the description of a hitherto unknown species of Priscaleclercera from mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber, Priscaleclercera christae sp. nov., bringing the total number of congeners to ten. By studying its morphological features, we argue that Priscaleclercera is a crown-group Psilodercidae, closely related to the AlthepuseLeclercera lineage. The high species diversity of Priscaleclercera indicates that Psilodercidae was already a diverse component of the Oriental tropical forests during the Cretaceous. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

First false darkling beetle from mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber (Coleoptera: Melandryidae). Alcheringa 44, 169-175. ISSN 0311-5518 The false darkling beetles (Melandryidae) are a small but morphologically diverse and taxonomically problematic family belonging to the polyphagan superfamily Tenebrionoidea. The Mesozoic record of Melandryidae is sparse, with only three described species. A new genus and species, Longicrusa jaracimrmani gen. et sp. nov., is described here from the mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber (ca 99 Ma), representing the oldest false darkling beetle described to date.

Here, we describe a Mesozoic species of this order, Siphonophora hui sp. nov., based on two well-preserved specimens from mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber. The new species can be placed in the family Siphonophoridae by having mouthparts strongly modified into a long beak, straight antennae, the separation of tergites, pleurites and sternites, leg-like gonopods derived from 9th and 10th leg pairs, and absence of ommatidia. This discovery pushes back the fossil record of Siphonophorida by more than 60 Ma. It also demonstrates that the details of the siphonophorid body plan have remained virtually unchanged for nearly 100 million years.

NOV.; WASPS; STEPHANOIDEA; CHECKLIST; SAWFLIES; FAMILY; ANTS; BEES,"A review of non-aculeate hymenoptera recorded in the world's Cretaceous amber assemblages is provided herein. Recorded are 287 species (265 named) representing 47 families in 17 amber assemblages. The richest in family number is the Burmese (Kachin) amber (35), followed by Canadian (19), Spanish (15), Kheta (12), Raritan (11), Charentese (10), Agapa (9) and Levantine (7) ones; hymenopterans in other ambers are less well documented. In the eight mentioned amber faunas, the share of extinct families decreases from 50/53 to 21 percent in a good correlation with their putative age, therefore suggesting a contiguous character of the studied world fauna. This inference is confirmed by the fact that endemic families are not recorded, with the only but prominent exception of the insular Burmese (Kachin) fauna with its 8 endemic families (23% of known hymenopteran families there). The rate of gradual loss of extinct families in succeeding amber assemblages shows that the main transformation took place during the first half of the Late Cretaceous, and not the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary. As taxonomic revisions, two species are placed in different families than originally ascribed to, namely, Albiogonalys elongatus Nel, Perrichot & Neraudeau, 2003, is transferred to Praeaulacidae, and Phoriostephanus exilis Engel & Huang, 2017, is transferred from Stephanidae to Roproniidae.

The well-preserved specimen was collected from the Upper Cretaceous (Cenomanian, ca. 99 Ma) amber near the Hukawng Valley of northern Myanmar. This fossil species can be assigned to the extant subfamily Eustrophinae based on its elongate oval and strongly narrowed posteriorly body, simple and narrow tarsi, and somewhat clubbed antennomeres. The comparison among the extinct and extant eustrophines supports the previous hypothesis that antennal morphology of early eustrophines was very diverse. Additionally, an overall similarity between Thescelostrophus and extant eustrophines suggests a potential fungivory of this fossil species. Morphological characters preserved in the Burmese amber highlight the diversity of tetratomids during the Late Mesozoic and provide data for future phylogenetic studies of Tetratomidae.

This has led to questions about whether the size bias inherent to preservation in amber has limited inclusions to smaller individuals or species, or if the avifauna of the amber-producing forest had a stronger representation of small-bodied taxa than other Cretaceous assemblages. A newly discovered inclusion of a fragmentary bird wing is described here: specimen LV-0321 likely belonged to an individual that was in excess of 10 cm long (snout to vent length). The new specimen also displays more prominent light-and-dark banding patterns among the primary flight feathers than any of the wings previously described from the deposit.

Total-evidence phylogenetic reconstruction is being increasingly used to assess the position of extinct taxa by incorporating morphological data from extinct and extant taxa together with molecular data from extant taxa in a united framework. Here we apply the method to two Cretaceous Burmese amber inclusions belonging to the rove beetle subfamily Paederinae. To perform the total evidence analysis, we constructed the first morphological matrix and the most comprehensive molecular dataset for the subfamily. Our analysis reveals an extinct lineage of Paederinae rove beetles with a suite of unique morphological characters, resulting in the description of a new genus: Diminudon gen. nov. and two new species: D. schomannae sp. nov. and D. kachinensis sp. nov. Simultaneously our analyses provide new insights into the evolution and classification of the entire subfamily. We also discuss the unusually small size of the newly described Paederinae, which may represent an additional case for miniaturization in the Cretaceous.","[Zyla, Dagmara; Shaw, Josh Jenkins] Univ Copenhagen, Biosystemat Sect, Nat Hist Museum Denmark, Univ Pk 15, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Zyla, Dagmara] Iowa State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, 2200 Osborn Dr,Bessey Hall, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Zyla, Dagmara] Univ Gdansk, Dept Invertebrate Zool & Parasitol, Wita Stwosza 59, PL-80308 Gdansk, Poland; [Yamamoto, Shuhei] Field Museum Nat Hist, Integrat Res Ctr, 1400 S Lake Shore Dr, Chicago, IL 60605 USA","Zyla, D (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Biosystemat Sect, Nat Hist Museum Denmark, Univ Pk 15, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.; Zyla, D (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, 2200 Osborn Dr,Bessey Hall, Ames, IA 50011 USA.; Zyla, D (corresponding author), Univ Gdansk, Dept Invertebrate Zool & Parasitol, Wita Stwosza 59, PL-80308 Gdansk, Poland.",zyladagmara@gmail.com; s.yamamoto.64@gmail.com; joshjenkins@btinternet.com,"Yamamoto, Shuhei/U-8247-2018","Yamamoto, Shuhei/0000-0002-4162-8457; Zyla, Dagmara/0000-0003-4959-763X",,,,89,6,6,2,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0031-0239,1475-4983,,PALAEONTOLOGY,Paleontology,NOV,2019,62,6,,,,,935,949,,10.1111/pala.12435,,,15,Paleontology,Paleontology,JU0PF,WOS:000501381000004,,,,,2021-07-18

This confirms the presence of the extant hard tick genus Amblyomma C. L. Koch, 1844 (Ixodida: Ixodidae) in the Late Cretaceous. This discovery is placed in its wider context and some reports of fossil hard ticks, such as a Hyalomma C. L. Koch, 1844 in Eocene Baltic amber, are misidentifications. The genus Amblyomma belongs to the clade Metastriata, a group which probably also accommodates two extinct genera, Cornupalpatum Poinar and Brown, 2003 and Compluriscutata Poinar and Buckley, 2008, also found in Burmese amber. All three fossils are thus only a little younger than published molecular divergence time estimates (ca. 124 +/- 17 Ma) for the Metastriata lineage. Amblyomma has a largely Gondwanan distribution today. However, in some biogeographical scenarios, e.g. the Samafrica model, its predicted radiation time postdates the dissolution of the original Gondwana supercontinent raising questions about how its current distribution pattern was achieved.","[Chitimia-Dobler, Lidia] Bundeswehr Inst Microbiol, Neuherbergstr 11, D-80937 Munich, Germany; [Chitimia-Dobler, Lidia] German Ctr Infect Res DZIF Partner Munich, Munich, Germany; [De Araujo, Bruno Cancian; Ruthensteiner, Bernhard] Zool Staatssammlung Munchen, Munchhausenstr 21, D-81247 Munich, Germany; [Pfeffer, Timo] Keyence Deutschland GmbH, Siemensstr 1, D-63263 Neu Isenburg, Germany; [Dunlop, Jason A.] Leibniz Inst Evolut & Biodivers Sci, Museum Nat Kunde, Invalidenstr 43, D-10115 Berlin, Germany","Dunlop, JA (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Evolut & Biodivers Sci, Museum Nat Kunde, Invalidenstr 43, D-10115 Berlin, Germany.",jason.dunlop@mfn-berlin.de,"de Araujo, Bruno Cancian/AAA-4969-2019; Dunlop, Jason A./AAC-8042-2019","Cancian de Araujo, Bruno/0000-0002-0562-917X",,,,48,15,16,0,7,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0031-1820,1469-8161,,PARASITOLOGY,Parasitology,SEP,2017,144,11,,,,,1441,1448,,10.1017/S0031182017000853,,,8,Parasitology,Parasitology,FE5TA,WOS:000408272800004,28583219,Bronze,,,2021-07-18

The family Odontoceridae contains 18 disparate genera, but there are no good diagnostic characters, which makes it difficult to place fossil taxa in this family. We here offer a revised diagnosis for the family, highlighting the lack of good diagnostic characters, and the need to use sets of characters to place (extinct) taxa in this family. On this taxonomic basis we describe two new species in the hitherto monotypic fossil genus Palaeopsilotreta Wichard & Wang, 2017 (Odontoceridae), Palaeopsilotreta burmanica sp. nov. and P. cretacea sp. nov., redescribe the type species based on additional information, and describe features of the female, based on two specimens, one of which is embedded adjacent to a male identified as P. xiai. Males of Palaeopsilotreta bear bipectinate antennae; the antennae of the females are simple and filiform. Similarly, bipectinate antennae are present in the third species we describe, Bipectinata orientalis gen. et sp. nov., which otherwise lacks the character combinations associated with the Odontoceridae, but clearly can be assigned to the family Calamoceratidae.","[Wichard, Wilfried] Univ Cologne, Inst Biol & Its Didact, Herbert Lewinstr 2, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; [Espeland, Marianne] Zool Res Museum Alexander Koenig, Arthropoda Dept, Adenauer Allee 160, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Mueller, Patrick] Friedhofstr 9, D-66894 Kashofen, Germany; [Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China","Espeland, M (corresponding author), Zool Res Museum Alexander Koenig, Arthropoda Dept, Adenauer Allee 160, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",Wichard@uni-koeln.de; M.Espeland@leibniz-zfmk.de; pat14789@web.de; bowang@nigpas.ac.cn,,,"Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDA19050101, XDB26000000]; Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research [2019QZKK0706]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41622201, 41688103]","We are grateful to Alice Wells and Tobias Malm for their valuable comments on the manuscript.

We report the first Cretaceous ostracod in amber-the gigantic (12.9 mm) right valve of an exclusively marine group (Myodocopa: Myodocopida) preserved in Burmese amber. Ostracods are usually small (0.5-2 mm), with well-calcified carapaces that provide an excellent fossil record extending to at least the Ordovician (similar to 485 million years ago), but they are rarely encountered in amber. The new specimen effectively doubles the age of the ostracod amber record, offering the first representative of the Myodocopa, a weakly calcified group with a poor fossil record. Its carapace morphology is atypical and likely plesiomorphic. The preserved valve appears to be either a moulted exuvium or a dead and disarticulated specimen, and subsequent resin flows contain forest floor inclusions with terrestrial arthropods, i.e., fragmentary remains of spiders, and insect frass. These features resolve an enigmatic taphonomic pathway, and support a marginal marine setting for resin production.","[Xing, Lida; Xi, Dangpeng; Wan, Xiaoqiao] China Univ Geosci, State Key Lab Biogeol & Environm Geol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Xing, Lida; Xi, Dangpeng; Wan, Xiaoqiao] China Univ Geosci, Sch Earth Sci & Resources, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Sames, Benjamin] Univ Vienna, Geozentrum, Dept Geodynam & Sedimentol, Althanstr 14, A-1090 Vienna, Austria; [Sames, Benjamin] Sam Noble Museum, 2401 Chautauqua Ave, Norman, OK 73072 USA; [McKellar, Ryan C.] Royal Saskatchewan Museum, Regina, SK S4P 4W7, Canada; [McKellar, Ryan C.] Univ Regina, Biol Dept, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada; [Bai, Ming] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Xing, LD (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, State Key Lab Biogeol & Environm Geol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.; Xing, LD (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, Sch Earth Sci & Resources, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.; Sames, B (corresponding author), Univ Vienna, Geozentrum, Dept Geodynam & Sedimentol, Althanstr 14, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.; Sames, B (corresponding author), Sam Noble Museum, 2401 Chautauqua Ave, Norman, OK 73072 USA.",xinglida@gmail.com; benjamin.sames@univie.ac.at,,"Xing, Lida/0000-0003-3923-9206","National Geographic Society, USANational Geographic Society [EC0768-15]; National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41772008, 41790455, 31672345]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2652017215]; Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [YZ201509]; Austrian Science Fund (FWF)Austrian Science Fund (FWF) [P 27687]; UNESCO-IUGS [IGCP 609]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR [2015-00681]","We thank Guobiao Li and Quanguo Li (China University of Geosciences Beijing, China), Michael J.

Divergence time estimates suggest that the genus originated in the Mesozoic; however, fossil evidence to validate this suggestion has been lacking. Amber from Myanmar (Burmese amber) is an important source of new information on the diversity of vascular cryptogams in the Cretaceous. This paper describes the fossil taxon Cystodium sorbifolioides nov. sp. based on a fragment of a fertile leaf preserved in Burmese amber that represents the first fossil evidence of the family Cystodiaceae. Cystodium sorbifolioides is used to obtain a minimum age estimate for the Cystodiaceae and the closely related, monogeneric Lonchitidaceae and Lindsaeaceae. The fossil strengthens the hypothesis that the forest ecosystems of Malesia and Melanesia represent refugia for many tropical plant lineages that originated in the Cretaceous.","[Regalado, Ledis; Heinrichs, Jochen] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Biol, Fac Biol, Menzinger Str 67, D-80638 Munich, Germany; [Regalado, Ledis; Heinrichs, Jochen] Geobioctr, Menzinger Str 67, D-80638 Munich, Germany; [Regalado, Ledis] Inst Ecol & Sistemat, Carretera Varona 11835 E Oriente & Lindero, Havana 11900, Cuba; [Schmidt, Alexander R.] Univ Gottingen, Dept Geobiol, Goldschmidtstr 3, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Appelhans, Marc S.] Univ Gottingen, Albrecht von Haller Inst Plant Sci, Dept Systemat Biodivers & Evolut Plants, Untere Karspuele 2, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Ilsemann, Bork; Krings, Michael] SNSB Bayer Staatssammlung Palaontol & Geol, Richard Wagner Str 10, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Schneider, Harald] Ctr Integrat Conservat, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, Mengla 666303, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Schneider, Harald] Nat Hist Museum, Dept Life Sci, Cromwell Rd, London SW7 5BD, England; [Krings, Michael] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Earth & Environm Sci Palaeontol & Geobiol, Richard Wagner Str 10, D-80333 Munich, Germany","Krings, M (corresponding author), SNSB Bayer Staatssammlung Palaontol & Geol, Richard Wagner Str 10, D-80333 Munich, Germany.; Krings, M (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Earth & Environm Sci Palaeontol & Geobiol, Richard Wagner Str 10, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",m.krings@lrz.uni-muenchen.de,"Krings, Michael/AAM-6436-2020; Schneider, Harald/B-6681-2008","Schneider, Harald/0000-0002-4548-7268",,,,46,7,8,0,4,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,NOV 3,2017,7,,,,,,,,14615,10.1038/s41598-017-14985-7,,,9,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,FL7GX,WOS:000414416200021,29097728,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2021-07-18

Recently, they were reported to be associated with Burmese amber. However, most of specimens from previous reports were preserved on the amber surface or within the sediment surrounding the amber. Based on X-ray tomography and thin-section optical microscopy of Burmese amber, we report here the first genuine and unambiguous evidence of inclusion of crinoid ossicles preserved in the fossil resin. Preservation of this exclusively marine group in amber gives insights into the paleoenvironment of the crinoid-amber association and provides additional evidence to support previous observations of shallow-water stalked crinoids from the mid-Cretaceous, when many stalked crinoids started to shift offshore due to increased predation pressure during the Mesozoic Marine Revolution. Crinoid remains, represented by disarticulated stem and arm ossicles assignable to Isocrinus cf. legeri (Repelin), point to a mid-Cretaceous age for the Burmese amber and support some previous hypotheses suggesting a close proximity between the resin-producing trees and seawater.","[Salamon, Mariusz A.] Univ Silesia Katowice, Fac Earth Sci, Bedzinska St 60, PL-41200 Sosnowiec, Poland; [Lin, Jih-Pai] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 106, Taiwan; [Duda, Pioir] Univ Silesia Katowice, Fac Comp Seienee & Mat Sci, 75 Pulku Piechoty 1, PL-41500 Chorzow, Poland; [Gorzelak, Przhmyslaw] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Paleobiol, Twarda 51-55, PL-00815 Warsaw, Poland; [Ausich, William, I] Ohio State Univ, Sch Earth Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Oji, Tatsuo] Nagoya Univ, Univ Museum, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan","Salamon, MA (corresponding author), Univ Silesia Katowice, Fac Earth Sci, Bedzinska St 60, PL-41200 Sosnowiec, Poland.",xyloplax1@gmail.com,"Gorzelak, Przemyslaw/B-6329-2015; Oji, Tatsuo/A-1840-2009","Gorzelak, Przemyslaw/0000-0001-5706-1881; Oji, Tatsuo/0000-0002-1034-1111; Duda, Piotr/0000-0003-3575-5641; Salamon, Mariusz/0000-0001-9399-2798","European Regional Development Fund within the Innovation Economy Operational Programme [POIG.02.02.00-00-025/09]; Taiwan-ROC Ministry of Science and Technology grants [MOST 105-2116-M-002-012, MOST 106-2116-M-002-018, MOST 107-2116-M-002-007]","This work has been benefited from constructive comments raised by James Saulsbury, anonymous reviewer and Associate Editor (Samuel Zamora).

The species shows some resemblance with the mecopteran family Bittacidae, mainly due to strongly elongated and thin legs. However, the structural affinities are apparently due to convergency. Different features, but especially the mouthparts and the pattern of wing venation, indicate that the species belongs to the extinct order t Permopsocida (?Archipsyllidae). However, it differs markedly from all species previously described in this extinct group. The very thin and strongly elongated legs are probably autapomorphic. A very unusual feature is the antenna with only seven segments and extremely elongated flagellomeres. The two pairs of wings are unusually narrow. M and CuA are basally fused. Proximal rows of spines, two series of closed cells, and a distinctly increased number of terminal branches of M are present in the forewings, in contrast to other archipsyllid genera. It is conceivable that Bittacopsocus megacephalus used its long legs to rest suspended in the vegetation like Bittacus.

Magniocula is placed in the extant subfamily Euthyrrhaphinae based on the small pubescent body, large clypeus surpassing the distal border of the antennal sockets, and two spines at apex of the front femur. However, this new genus is unique among Euthyrrhaphinae for its holoptic eyes. This is the second corydiid species found in Cretaceous Burmese amber, which highlights the palaeodiversity of the family Corydiidae in the mid-Cretaceous. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Haemaphysalis (Alloceraea) cretacea sp. nov. is the oldest and only fossil representative of this genus; living members of which predominantly feed on mammals. Their typical hosts are known since at least the Jurassic and the discovery of a mid-Cretaceous parasite, which might have fed on mammals raises again the question of to what extent ticks are coupled to their (modern) host groups. An inferred Triassic split of Argasidae (soft ticks) into the bird-preferring Argasinae and mammal-preferring Ornithodorinae dates to about the time when dinosaurs (later including birds) and mammaliaforms as potential hosts were emerging. Ixodidae may have split into Prostriata and Metastriata shortly after the end-Permian mass extinction, an event which fundamentally altered the terrestrial vertebrate fauna. Prostriata (the genus Ixodes) prefer birds and mammals today, and some may have used groups like cynodonts in the Triassic. Basal metastriate ticks (e.g. Amblyomma) prefer reptiles, but derived metastriates (including Haemaphysalis) again prefer mammals. Here, we may be looking at a younger (Cretaceous?) shift associated with more recent mammalian radiations.","[Chitimia-Dobler, Lidia] Bundeswehr Inst Microbiol, Neuherbergstr 11, D-80937 Munich, Germany; [Chitimia-Dobler, Lidia] German Ctr Infect Res DZIF Partner Munich, Munich, Germany; [Pfeffer, Timo] Keyence Deutschland GmbH, Siemensstr 1, D-63263 Neu Isenburg, Germany; [Dunlop, Jason A.] Museum Nat Kunde, Leibniz Inst Evolut & Biodivers Sci, Invalidenstr 43, D-10115 Berlin, Germany","Dunlop, JA (corresponding author), Museum Nat Kunde, Leibniz Inst Evolut & Biodivers Sci, Invalidenstr 43, D-10115 Berlin, Germany.",jason.dunlop@mfn-berlin.de,"Dunlop, Jason A./AAC-8042-2019",,,,,98,5,6,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0031-1820,1469-8161,,PARASITOLOGY,Parasitology,SEP,2018,145,11,,,,,1440,1451,,10.1017/S0031182018000537,,,12,Parasitology,Parasitology,GS5PQ,WOS:000443719400009,29642954,,,,2021-07-18

These inclusions show a suite of characters that were not visible in the type specimen of F. cretacea. The new gametophytes consistently display rectangular to ovate underleaves that have two long-ciliate apical teeth in addition to 0-2 blunt lateral teeth. A narrow stylus is present on at least some leaves. The lobules usually form water sacs that are 1.2-2.3 times longer than wide, and are arranged at some distance from the stem. The observed combination of character states is not present in extant crown group lineages of Frullania. A syninclusion in one of the amber pieces is interpreted as a detached gynoecium of a second Cretaceous Frullania species and is described as F. baerlocheri, sp. nov. The subgynoecial underleaves of the syninclusion are suborbicular in shape, and allow for a separation of this species from F. cretacea. The described amber inclusions are the oldest representatives of an extant genus of leafy liverworts known so far. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Although the specimen described herein represents a winged terrestrial life stage, it retains tufts of branched gill filaments similar to larval gills on several body parts, including the first eight abdominal segments; a pattern which is unique within the order Plecoptera. The extent of adult gill remnants is evaluated as highly variable within Petroperlidae, probably subject to selective pressures resulting from microhabitat partitioning among various species of this Cretaceous family.

It appears to be an ancestral stem lineage of the recent Lignopholas piddocks, which are estuarine to freshwater bivalves, boring into wood and mudstone rocks. Frequent occurrences and high abundance of dagger Palaeolignopholas borings and preserved shells in the Kachin amber could indicate that the resin-producing forest was partly situated near a downstream (estuarine to freshwater) section of a river. Multiple records of freshwater invertebrates (caddisflies, mayflies, stoneflies, odonates, and chironomids) in this amber could also manifest in favor of our paleo-environmental reconstruction, although a variety of local freshwater environments is known to occur in coastal settings.","[Bolotov, Ivan N.; Aksenova, Olga V.; Vikhrev, Ilya V.; Konopleva, Ekaterina S.; Chapurina, Yulia E.; Kondakov, Alexander V.] Northern Arctic Fed Univ, Northern Dvina Emb 17, Arkhangelsk 163002, Russia; [Bolotov, Ivan N.; Aksenova, Olga V.; Vikhrev, Ilya V.; Konopleva, Ekaterina S.; Chapurina, Yulia E.; Kondakov, Alexander V.] Russian Acad Sci, Ural Branch, N Laverov Fed Ctr Integrated Arctic Res, Northern Dvina Emb 23, Arkhangelsk 163000, Russia","Bolotov, IN (corresponding author), Northern Arctic Fed Univ, Northern Dvina Emb 17, Arkhangelsk 163002, Russia.; Bolotov, IN (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, Ural Branch, N Laverov Fed Ctr Integrated Arctic Res, Northern Dvina Emb 23, Arkhangelsk 163000, Russia.",inepras@yandex.ru,,,"Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation [0793-2020-0005, AAAA-A18-118012390161-9]; Russian Foundation for Basic ResearchRussian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR) [18-44-292001]","We are deeply grateful to Dr. Ru Smith (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia) and an anonymous reviewer for their valuable comments on earlier versions of this paper.

Here, we report the occurrence of two additional species, Zorotypus (Octozoros) cenomanianus sp. n., and Z. (s. str) denticulatus sp. n., in Burmese amber. The former new species shares with Z. nascimbenei Engel & Grimaldi, Z. acanthothorax Engel & Grimaldi, and Z. hudae (Kaddumi) a reduced number of antennomeres (eight), while the latter possesses nine-segmented antennae similar to Z. cretatus Engel & Grimaldi. Both new species are readily separable from known extinct congeners by features of the antenna, nota, wings, and terminal abdominal segments, as well as the spination of the metafemur and metatibia. The discovery of two additional Zorotypus species in Myanmar amber suggests a potentially higher diversity of Burmese zorapterans in tropical forests than currently documented. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The specimens recovered from this deposit preserve skeletal material and soft tissues in unmatched detail. This provides opportunities to study three-dimensional preservation of soft tissues, microstructure, and pigmentation patterns that are seldom available else-where in the fossil record. Ultimately, this line of research provides insights into life stages that are difficult to preserve, the ecology and appearance of the groups involved, and the evolutionary-development of structures such as feathers. Here we describe the most recent discovery from Burmese amber, an articulated skeleton of an enantiornithine bird. This individual has been sectioned along the coronal plane, providing a unique view inside multiple body regions. Osteological observations and plumage patterns support placement within the Enantiornithes, and suggest that the animal may have been a juvenile at the time of death. The specimen has a complex taphonomic history that includes exposure at the surface of a resin flow prior to encapsulation, and may include scavenging by some of the insects trapped within the same amber piece. The chemical composition observed along surface exposures and shallowly buried regions of the body indicate that the specimen has not undergone significant exchange with its surroundings. High iron concentrations are present in regions that preserve soft tissues as carbon films, and calcium distribution corresponds to regions where bones breach the surface of the amber.

In contrast to the large amount and great diversity of terrestrial species retrieved so far, aquatic biota constitute rare inclusions. Here we describe the first freshwater snail ever preserved in amber. The new species Galba prima sp. nov. belongs in the family Lymnaeidae, today a diverse and near globally distributed family. Its inclusion in terrestrial amber is probably a result of the amphibious lifestyle typical of modern representatives of the genus. The finding of a freshwater snail on the Burma Terrane, back then an island situated at some 1500 km from mainland Asia, has implications for the dispersal mechanisms of Mesozoic lymnaeids. The Cenomanian species precedes the evolution of waterfowl, which are today considered a main vector for long-distance dispersal. In their absence, we discuss several hypotheses to explain the disjunct occurrence of the new species.","[Yu, Tingting] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Yu, Tingting] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Yu, Tingting] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Neubauer, Thomas A.] Justus Liebig Univ, Dept Anim Ecol & Systemat, D-35392 Giessen, Germany; [Neubauer, Thomas A.] Naturalis Biodivers Ctr, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands; [Jochum, Adrienne] Nat Hist Museum Burgergemeinde Bern, CH-3005 Bern, Switzerland; [Jochum, Adrienne] Senckenberg Forsch Inst, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany; [Jochum, Adrienne] Natl Museum, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany","Yu, TT (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China.; Yu, TT (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China.; Yu, TT (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",ttyu@nigpas.ac.cn,,"Yu, Tingting/0000-0003-3154-0598; Neubauer, Thomas A./0000-0002-1398-9941","Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDA19050101, XDB26000000]; Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research [2019QZKK0706]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41688103]","We are grateful to Gerald Mayr for discussing long-distance dispersal capabilities of Mesozoic birds and pterosaurs.

They are similar in form to Teredolites clavatus Leymerie, 1842 and Gastrochaenolites lapidicus Kelly & Bromley, 1984; however, the former identification is preferable, given that they are martesiine crypts in amber as opposed to a lithic substrate. Cross-cutting relationships between the clavate features and inclusions in the amber demonstrate that the features post-date hardening of the resin. The fills of the crypts are variable, including sand grade sediment of very fine to coarse sand grainsize, and sparry calcite cements. In some cases, the articulated valves of the pholadid bivalve responsible are visible inside the borings. However, one remarkable specimen contains two pairs of articulated shells 'floating' in amber, not associated with crypts; an observation that suggests that the resin was still liquid or soft when the bivalves were trapped in the resin. One individual is associated with an irregular sediment-filled feature and shows shell breakage. Formation of a solid rim around a liquid central volume has been documented in subaqueous bodies of resin in modern swamp forests, and argues for a close proximity between the amber-producing trees and a brackish water habitat for the bivalves. The presence of pyrite as thin films and crystal groups within Burmese amber is further consistent with such a depositional environment. Comparison of the size of pholadid body fossils with growth rates of modern equivalents allows the duration of boring activities to be estimated and suggests that small fossil pholadids in Burmese amber became trapped and died within 1-2 weeks of having settled on the resin. Larger examples present within well-formed domichnia formed in hardened resin. Since 'hardground' describes early lithified sediment as a substrate and 'woodground' describes wood as a substrate, the term 'amberground' is used here to described borings in an amber substrate.","[Smith, Ru D.

One of the most peculiar feather morphotypes discovered to date are rachis dominated feathers (RDFs), which have also been referred to as proximally ribbon-like pennaceous feathers (PRPFs). These elongate feathers are only found in the tail plumage, typically occurring in pairs with both streamer (not proximally ribbon-like) and racket-plume morphologies recognized. Here we describe a large sample set of isolated and paired RDFs from Upper Cretaceous Burmese amber (similar to 99 Ma). Amber preserves the finest details of these fragile structures in three dimensions, demonstrating that RDFs form a distinct feather morphotype with a ventrally open rachis, and with significant variability in pigmentation, microstructure, and symmetry.","[Xing, Lida] China Univ Geosci Beijing, State Key Lab Biogeol & Environm Geol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Xing, Lida] China Univ Geosci Beijing, Sch Earth Sci & Resources, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Cocio, Pierre; McKellar, Ryan C.] Royal Saskatchewan Museum, Regina, SK S4P 4W7, Canada; [Cocio, Pierre; McKellar, Ryan C.] Univ Regina, Biol Dept, Regina, SK S4S 0A7, Canada; [McKellar, Ryan C.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [O'Connor, Jingmai] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Paleontol & Paleoanthropol, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China","McKellar, RC (corresponding author), Royal Saskatchewan Museum, Regina, SK S4P 4W7, Canada.; McKellar, RC (corresponding author), Univ Regina, Biol Dept, Regina, SK S4S 0A7, Canada.; McKellar, RC (corresponding author), Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.",ryan.mckellar@gov.sk.ca,,"McKellar, Ryan/0000-0002-7451-4368; Cockx, Pierre/0000-0002-9624-6878","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41772008]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2652017215]; National Geographic Society, U.S.A.National Geographic Society [EC0768-15]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) [2015-00681]; RSM scholarship; Paul Riegert scholarship","We thank National Natural Science Foundation of China (41772008), Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (2652017215), National Geographic Society, U.S.A.

The remarkable preservation of dagger Z. hoelldobleri sp.n. sheds considerable light on the functional morphology of zigrasimeciine mouthparts. Due to the ferocious function of the mouthparts of dagger Zigrasimecia and dagger Protozigrasinlecia, we colloquially dub these the iron maiden ants.

Passalopalpidae fam. nov., Passalopalpus cheni gen. et sp. nov., are probably extinct since a long time. Observations were made on the whole body (head, thorax, abdomen) and appendages (mouthparts, antennae, legs, wings). Most characters are remarkable and plesiomorphic, compared to Passalidae Leach, as well as to some other Scarabaeoidea. Morphological characteristics demonstrate that the fossil species is typically passaloid, but that it cannot belongs to Passalidae. Passalopalpidae and Passalidae are clearly distinct families, with strong assumption to be sister groups. The systematic interpretation of the fossil could fill a historic gap: the sister group of Passalidae had been established previously never in a solid way. Passalids are Gondwanian, whereas passalopalpids lived on former eastern Laurasia. Vicariance of both taxa, each on one of the super-continents, seems to support recent hypotheses of phylogeny and paleobiogeography for Passalidae.

Here we describe Cretodeinopsis aenigmatica gen. et sp. nov., the first definitive Mesozoic aleocharine based on a well-preserved individual in the earliest Late Cretaceous (Cenomanian) amber from Myanmar (Burma). The new genus is clearly assigned to the 'basal' group of Aleocharinae based on its overall body shape, antennal insertions on the vertex of the head, and emarginate posterolateral margins of elytra. It is placed in the Recent tribe Deinopsini based on the strongly deflexed head, pectinate edge of abdominal segments III-V, tarsal structures, and non-pentamerous tarsi. The new discovery of the oldest known Aleocharinae from about 99 Mya represents a new aleocharine belonging to the 'basal' group of Aleocharinae, reinforcing the hypothesis that Gymnusa, Stylogymnusa and the tribe Deinopsini probably form a monophyletic lineage and suggest that the monophyly of Gymnusini is not supported based on the presence of 6 setigerous pores on the head. It indicates that the origin of the subfamily probably predates the Cenomanian. This new discovery is about 55 Ma older than the previously known Eocene-aged ones from Baltic amber, greatly broadening our knowledge on the early evolution of Aleocharinae.

Compared with known extinct zorapterans, the new species possesses eight-segmented antennae and can be readily distinguished from all other extinct and recent members of the order in the presence of a shallow groove connecting two antennal sockets and by unique spination of the metafemur and metatibia. The earliest known suspicious mating behavior of Zoraptera, the intromittent organ of the fossil zorapterans, the egg, and the earliest known basal plate of the male genitalia are briefly discussed. The genitalia of new species are used as an intromittent organ in the majority of mating patterns among living zorapterans. The mating patterns (a copula is performed by males and females) of the most extant species have been present since at least the mid-Cretaceous. A shared similar aedeagal structure in the new species and in the most extant species suggests an analogous mating behavior.","[Chen, Xinyu; Su, Guifen] CSCLR, Sanhe, Hebei, Peoples R China","Chen, XY (corresponding author), CSCLR, Sanhe, Hebei, Peoples R China.",64870422@qq.com; 505105991@qq.com,,"Chen, Xinyu/0000-0003-3995-4605",China Geological SurveyChina Geological Survey [12120115054101],"China Geological Survey, Grant/Award Number: 12120115054101",,30,3,4,1,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0947-5745,1439-0469,,J ZOOL SYST EVOL RES,J.

The chemical composition of Tilin amber suggests a tree source among conifers, indicating that gymnosperms were still abundant in the latest Campanian equatorial forests. Eight orders and 12 families of insects have been found in Tilin amber so far, making it the latest known diverse insect assemblage in the Mesozoic. The presence of ants of the extant subfamilies Dolichoderinae and Ponerinae supports that tropical forests were the cradle for the diversification of crown-group ants, and suggests that the turnover from stem groups to crown groups had already begun at similar to 72.1 Ma. Tilin amber biota fills a critical insect faunal gap and provides a rare insight into the latest Campanian forest ecosystem.","[Zheng, Daran; Mu, Lin; Kelly, Richard S.; Li, Sha; Zhang, Qi; Zhang, Qingqing; Wang, He; Fang, Yan; Zhang, Haichun; Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Daran; Mu, Lin; Kelly, Richard S.; Li, Sha; Zhang, Qi; Zhang, Qingqing; Wang, He; Fang, Yan; Zhang, Haichun; Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Daran; Chang, Su-Chin; Wong, Jean; Wang, Jun] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Earth Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Perrichot, Vincent] Univ Rennes, CNRS, Geosci Rennes, UMR 6118, F-35000 Rennes, France; [Dutta, Suryendu; Rudra, Arka] Indian Inst Technol, Dept Earth Sci, Bombay 400076, Maharashtra, India; [Kelly, Richard S.] Univ Bristol, Sch Earth Sci, Life Sci Bldg,Tyndall Ave, Bristol BS8 1TQ, Avon, England; [Wang, Bo] Shandong Univ Sci & Technol, Shandong Prov Key Lab Deposit Mineralizat & Sedim, Qingdao 266590, Shandong, Peoples R China","Wang, B (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Wang, B (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Chang, SC (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Dept Earth Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.; Wang, B (corresponding author), Shandong Univ Sci & Technol, Shandong Prov Key Lab Deposit Mineralizat & Sedim, Qingdao 266590, Shandong, Peoples R China.",suchin@hku.hk; bowang@nigpas.ac.cn,"Perrichot, Vincent/I-4134-2019","Perrichot, Vincent/0000-0002-7973-0430; Li, Sha/0000-0002-1268-5364; Thomson, Ulysses/0000-0001-7517-6674; Zheng, Daran/0000-0003-0520-6780","HKU Seed Funding Program for Basic ResearchUniversity of Hong Kong [201411159057]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41572010, 41622201, 41688103]; Strategic Priority Research Program (B) of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB26000000]","We are grateful to D.

The infrared spectra indicate that during the long geological process of amber formation, small resin molecules first crosslinked and slowly oxidized, eventually forming a stable organic polymer mixture. An analysis of Raman peak areas demonstrated that among the tested samples, the degree of polymerization is highest in Burmese amber and lowest in rosin. Ultraviolet-visible spectra indicate the presence of unsaturated bonds (e.g., carbonyl groups) or conjugated systems in Burmese amber, copal, and rosin. The evaluation of amber, rosin, and copal solubility in six solvents (ethanol, acetone, 1,4-dioxane, ethylacetate, N,N-dimethylamide, and dichloromethane) demonstrated that solubility decreases in the following order: rosin > copal > Burmese amber. Together, the results suggest that the structure of Burmese amber includes large organic molecules containing six-membered rings along with CH2, CH3, C=O, C=C, C-O, and C-C groups.","[Bai, Feng; Liang, Huifang; Qu, Hongting] China Univ Geosci Beijing, Sch Gemmol, 29 Xueyuan Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China","Bai, F (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci Beijing, Sch Gemmol, 29 Xueyuan Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",baifengbj@163.com; lianghuifang66@163.com; 1219582593@qq.com,,,,,,27,3,3,2,3,HINDAWI LTD,LONDON,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",2314-4920,2314-4939,,J SPECTROSC,J.

(Odonata: Zygoptera) is described from more than 14 specimens in eight pieces of mid-Cretaceous (earliest Cenomanian, ca. 99 Ma) amber from Myanmar. Possible phylogenetic affinities with the Neotropical Latibasaliidae, Thaumatoneuridae, and Pseudostigmatinae are discussed, and a relationship with Pseudostigmatinae considered as possible, but because of conflicting evidence separate family status as Mesomegaloprepidae fam. nov. is tentatively preferred. The remarkable degree of homoplastic conflict in the wing venational similarities indicates that these represent relatively weak evidence for phylogenetic relationships. The palaeoecology, including sexual dimorphism in wing colouration, of the new taxon is discussed, and the large number of inclusions explained with possible breeding behaviour in association with water-filled tree holes (phytotelmata) of the amber tree, similar to extant Pseudostigmatinae. The position of all alleged fossil Thaumatoneuridae are discussed and revised: Eothaumatoneura ptychoptera Pongracz, 1935 from the Eocene Geiseltal locality is restored in Thaumatoneuridae. Cretaceous Euarchistigma and Paleogene Eodysagrion are tentatively retained as subfamilies Euarchistigmatinae and Eodysagrioninae in Thaumatoneuridae. Paleogene Dysagrioninae and Petrolestinae are removed from Thaumatoneuridae and attributed to a restored family Dysagrionidae, and Paleocene Latibasaliidae is transferred from Amphipterygoidea to Epallagoidea.

By having some peculiarities in the body shape and structure of the head (elongate mandibles, reduced eyes, additional setigerous pores on frons and vertex), the new genus is rather distinct from the two modern genera Metrius Eschscholtz, 1829 and Sinometrius Wrase et Schmidt, 2006, each with restricted distribution in western North America (Metrius) and in East Asia (Sinometrius). Like the modern members of Metriini, the new genus could inhabit forests and keep a predaceous mode of life. A compact body with legs not adapted to digging and reduced eyes in Kryzhanovskiana olegi gen. et sp. nov. seem to indicate on inhabitance in dark enclosed interspaces, such as thick layers of dead wood or hollows in rotten tree trunks. The discovery of a new remarkable representative of the tribe Metriini in Cretaceous Burmese amber confirms the previous suggestions that Metriini represent an old relict group of Carabidae which was more diverse and more widely distributed in the past. Hypotheses on evolution of the tribe Metriini are discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The specimens are described combining classical light microscopy with drawings and photography, and modern micro-computed tomography (mu CT). Morphological characters otherwise obscured are examined and visualized by creating volume renderings and 3D-segmentations from mu CT data. Electrocambalidae fam. nov. is characterized by the following character combination: (1) a forward shift of leg pair 3, resulting in an apparently legless 3rd body ring, (2) presence of metazonital setae, and (3) extensive pilosity on the head. Although some of these characters are shared with other Juliformia they are unique in this combination.

One mass is composed of relatively stiff eggs that retain their shape throughout the mass and may be linked by mucoid strands. This morphology resembles that of some terrestrial molluscs.

Based on morphological characters of all extant and extinct genera, a phylogenetic analysis of Stephanidae was conducted. The results indicate that Schlettereriinae and Stephaninae are monophyletic, whereas ElectrostephanusBrues, as the only genus within Electrostephaninae, belongs to Stephaninae. Therefore, we propose a synonymy of Electrostephaninae with Stephaninae.

Features supporting this are the lobe-like terminal elements of the legs and the pattern of setae on the abdomen. However the larva display specialized features differing from immatures of extant ripiphorid species, such as for instance the absence of stemmata and the presence of ventral transverse rows of spines.

Here we describe the first extinct genus of Nosodendridae from mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber from northern Myanmar (ca. 99 Ma). Basinosa pengwen gen. et sp. nov. can be distinguished from extant genera by a combination of potentially plesiomorphic characters, namely its strongly protuberant compound eyes, long prosternum, slender tarsi, elongate tibiae not strongly widened apically, and metacoxae narrowly separated by a sharp anterior process of the basalmost abdominal ventrite. The new fossil provides further evidence of an ancient origin of Nosodendridae and a 'missing link' between the family and more basal polyphagan superfamilies. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Age of the material was ambiguous, but probably Cretaceous. Numerous new records and taxa occur in this amber, based on newly excavated material in the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) containing 3100 organisms. Without having all groups studied, significant new records and taxa thus far include the following (a 1 refers to extinct taxa): For Plants: An angiosperm flower (only the third in Cretaceous amber), spores and apparent sporangia of an unusual but common fungus, hepatophyte thalli and an archegoniophore of Marchantiaceae, and leafy shoots of Metasequoia (Coniferae). Metasequoia is possibly the source of the amber. For Animals: Mermithidae and other Nematoda; the oldest ixodid tick (a larval Amblyomma); bird feathers; and the only Mesozoic record of the Onychophora (velvet worms), described as *Cretoperipatus burmiticus, n. gen., n. sp. (Peripatidae). Poinar's classification of the Onychophora is substantially revised. Still largely unstudied, the fauna of mites (Acari) and spiders (Araneae) appears to be the most diverse ones known for the Mesozoic. For Insecta: Odonata indet. (wing fragment); Plecoptera indet.; new genera of Dermaptera, Embiidina, and Zoraptera (the latter two as the only definitive Mesozoic fossils of their orders). Within Hemiptera, there are primitive new genera in the Aradidae, Hydrometridae, Piesmatidae, Schizopteridae, and Cimicomorpha (Heteroptera), as well as in *Tajmyraphididae (Aphidoidea), and *Protopsyllidiidae. An adult snakefly (Raphidioptera: *Mesoraphidiidae) is the smallest species in the order, and new genera occur in the Neuroptera: Coniopterygidae, Berothidae, and Psychopsidae, as well as larvae of apparent Nevrorthidae. Coleoptera are largely unstudied, but are probably the most diverse assemblage known from the Cretaceous, particularly for Staphylinidae. An adult lymexylid, the most primitive species of Atractocerus, is the first Mesozoic record of the family. In Hymenoptera there are primitive ants (Formicidae: Ponerinae n. gen., and *Sphecomyrma n.sp [Sphecomyrminae]), the oldest record of the Pompilidae, and significant new records of *Serphitidae and *Stigmaphronidae, among others. Diptera are the most diverse and abundant, with the oldest definitive Blephariceridae and mosquito (Culicidae), as well as new genera in the Acroceridae, Bibionidae, Empidoidea; a new genus near the enigmatic genus Valeseguya, and an unusual new genus in the *Archizelmiridae. *Chimeromyia (Diptera: Eremoneura), known previously in ambers from the Lower Cretaceous, is also represented. The stratigraphic distribution of exclusively Mesozoic arthropods in Burmese amber is reviewed, which indicates a probable Turonian-Cenomanian age of this material (90-100 Ma). Paleofaunal differences between the NHML and AMNH collections are discussed, as is the distinct tropical nature of the original biota. Burmese amber probably harbors the most diverse biota in amber from the Cretaceous, and one of the most diverse Mesozoic microbiotas now known.","Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrates, New York, NY 10024 USA; Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; Univ Kansas, Div Entomol, Museum Nat Hist, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; Univ Kansas, Biodiver Res Ctr, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA","Grimaldi, DA (corresponding author), Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrates, New York, NY 10024 USA.",grimaldi@amnh.org; nosh@amnh.org,"Engel, Michael S/C-5461-2012","Engel, Michael S/0000-0003-3067-077X",,,,178,565,635,2,83,AMER MUSEUM NATURAL HISTORY,NEW YORK,"ATTN: LIBRARY-SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATIONS DISTRIBUTION, CENTRAL PK WEST AT 79TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10024-5192 USA",0003-0082,1937-352X,,AM MUS NOVIT,Am.

Avoidance of visual predators has resulted in different kinds of anti-predator defences, such as: camouflage, crypsis, disruptive coloration, and masquerade or mimesis. Camouflage is one of the forms involving shape, colouration, structure and behaviour when the visual pattern and orientation of an animal can determine whether it lives or dies. Inferring the behaviour and function of an ancient organism from its fossilised remains is a difficult task, but in many cases it closely resembles that of its descendants on uniformitarian grounds. Here we report and discuss examples of morphological and behavioural traits involving camouflage named recently as a flatoidinisation syndrome, shown by the inclusion of a planthopper in mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber. We found a new genus and species of an extinct Cretaceous planthopper family Mimarachnidae showing peculiar complex morphological adaptations to camouflage it on tree bark. Due to convergence, it resembles an unrelated tropiduchid planthopper from Eocene Baltic amber and also a modern representatives of the planthopper family Flatidae. Flattening of the body, the horizontal position of the tegmina at repose, tegmina with an undulating margin and elevated, wavy longitudinal veins, together with colouration and more sedentary behavioral traits enable these different insects to avoid predators. Our discovery reveals flatoidinisation syndrome in mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber which may provide insights into the processes of natural selection and evolution in this ancient forest.","[Jiang, Tian] China Univ Geosci Beijing, 29 Xueyuan Rd, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Tian; Szwedo, Jacek; Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Tian; Szwedo, Jacek; Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Szwedo, Jacek] Univ Gdansk, Dept Invertebrate Zool & Parasitol, Lab Evolutionary Entomol, Fac Biol, 59 Wita Stwosza St, PL-80308 Gdansk, Poland; [Wang, Bo] Univ Gdansk, Museum Amber Inclus, Dept Invertebrate Zool & Parasitol, Fac Biol, 59 Wita Stwosza St, PL-80308 Gdansk, Poland; [Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Szwedo, J (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Szwedo, J (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Szwedo, J (corresponding author), Univ Gdansk, Dept Invertebrate Zool & Parasitol, Lab Evolutionary Entomol, Fac Biol, 59 Wita Stwosza St, PL-80308 Gdansk, Poland.",jacek.szwedo@biol.ug.edu.pl,"Szwedo, Jacek/B-4774-2013; Szwedo, Jacek/O-1442-2019","Szwedo, Jacek/0000-0002-2796-9538; Szwedo, Jacek/0000-0002-2796-9538","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41702018, 41790452, 41572010, 41622201, 41688103]; State Key Laboratory of Palaeobiology and Stratigraphy (Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, CAS)Chinese Academy of Sciences [173112]; China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2017M610955]; Strategic Priority Research Program (B) of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB26000000]; Chinese Academy of Sciences President's International Fellowship Initiative [2017VBA0024]","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41702018, 41790452), State Key Laboratory of Palaeobiology and Stratigraphy (Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, CAS) (No. 173112), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2017M610955) awarded to T.J., the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41572010, 41622201, 41688103), and the Strategic Priority Research Program (B) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDB26000000) awarded to B.

Samples representing golden, brown, red ('blood'), 'beeswax' and 'root' ambers were characterised, as well as those showing red or green 'oil gloss'; many of these also displayed phosphorescence. Common internal features seen with optical microscopy include reddish brown dot-like inclusions in brown amber and flow-banded concentrations of bubbles in 'beeswax' and 'root' ambers (the latter displaying patterns comprised of opaque light- and dark-coloured layers). SEM imagery revealed various scaly or layered structures on freshly broken surfaces, micro-bubbles in some samples and distinctive hollow micro-channels in 'root' amber. Fluorescence spectra recorded luminescence centres at 432 and 470 nm in all samples, and additionally at 650 nm (+/- 625 nm) in red 'oil gloss' amber. The 'oil gloss' appearance is caused by a mixture of surface fluorescence and the amber's body colour. Phosphorescence spectroscopy showed that the effect was strongest at 525 nm, and the phosphorescence lifetime measured at this emission wavelength ranged from 0.134 to 1.396 seconds.

So far, 38 fossil species belonging to six families have been described or recorded, most of Cenozoic age. Knowledge about the evolutionary history of the major groups of Gerromorpha is seriously hampered by the scarcity of well-preserved Mesozoic fossils, especially from the Cretaceous. The present paper reports on a well-preserved semiaquatic bug from amber collected in the northern part of Myanmar (Burma). The source of this fossiliferous amber was previously considered to be Eocene in age, but recent evidence indicates that it originated in the Middle Cretaceous (Turonian-Cenomanian), or 100-90 Ma. The fossil species is described as Carinametra burmensis gen. et sp. n. The presence of three pairs of cephalic trichobothria, a prolonged head, long slender antennae and legs, reduced wing venation, etc., places the fossil in the gerromorphan family Hydrometridae, or water measurers. Other characters suggest a close relationship with the two extant genera of the most basal of the hydrometrid subfamilies, Heterocleptinae. We present and discuss the available evidence used in the dating of Burmese amber. Finally, we discuss the phylogenetic, paleobiological, and biogeographic significance of the new fossil.","Univ Copenhagen, Zool Museum, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, New York, NY 10024 USA","Andersen, NM (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Zool Museum, Univ Pk 15, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.",nmandersen@zmuc.ku.dk; grimaldi@amnh.org,,,,,,36,18,21,0,5,BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",1399-560X,1876-312X,,INSECT SYST EVOL,Insect Syst.

Yet there is little direct evidence from the fossil record for the antiquity of this association. We describe four fossil frog specimens from mid- Cretaceous (similar to 99 mya) amber deposits from Kachin State, Myanmar for which the associated fauna provides rich paleoenvironmental context. Microcomputed tomographic analysis provides detailed three-dimensional anatomy for these small frogs, which is generally unavailable for articulated anurans in the Mesozoic. These crown-group anuran specimens provide the earliest direct evidence for anurans in a wet tropical forest. Based on a distinct combination of skeletal characters, at least one specimen has clear similarities to living alytoid frogs as well as several Mesozoic taxa known from the Jehol Biota in China. Whereas many Mesozoic frogs are from seasonal and mesic paleoenvironments, these fossils provide the earliest direct evidence of anurans in wet tropical forests.","[Xing, Lida] China Univ Geosci, State Key Lab Biogeol & Environm Geol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Xing, Lida] China Univ Geosci, Sch Earth Sci & Resources, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Stanley, Edward L.; Blackburn, David C.] Univ Florida, Florida Museum Nat Hist, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Bai, Ming] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Xing, LD (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, State Key Lab Biogeol & Environm Geol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.; Xing, LD (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, Sch Earth Sci & Resources, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.; Blackburn, DC (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Florida Museum Nat Hist, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",xinglida@gmail.com; dblackburn@flmnh.ufl.edu,"Blackburn, David C./L-3812-2019","Blackburn, David C./0000-0002-1810-9886; Stanley, Edward/0000-0001-5257-037X; Xing, Lida/0000-0003-3923-9206","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41790455, 41772008, 31672345]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2652017215]; National Geographic SocietyNational Geographic Society [EC0768-15]; Scientific Research Equipment Development Project of Chinese Academy of Sciences [YZ201509]; University of FloridaUniversity of Florida","We thank Mo Li (Hupozhu, Lijiang City, China) for providing specimens for study and Dr. Yuan Wang for access to specimens in the Institute for Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (Beijing, China).

It differs by the presence of a parietal inclusion in the aperture and by the weakly convex whorls with dense, diagonally aligned ribs on the last whorl. The genus Euthema is redescribed, and a new synonym recognised, Paleodiplommatina. A list of all currently described molluscan species from Burmese amber is provided. Lagocheilus electrospira is reassigned to the genus Eotrichophorus. The taxonomic diversity and abundance of molluscs in Burmese amber are discussed on the basis of 198 observed snail inclusions from amber trading exchange and published data. Apparently, molluscs are much more common in Burmese amber than in any other deposit of amber, with a notable predominance of Cyclophoroidea.

Two families are new; three genera are unplaced in Tabanomorpha and one unplaced within Brachycera. Comparisons are presented between the amber taxa and extensive lithified taxa from. the Jurassic and Cretaceous of eastern Laurasia. In Stratiomyomorpha: A new species of Zhangsolvidae has color patterns and body shape that apparently mimic Vespidae or other stinging aculeate wasps. Diverse new Xylomyidae and Stratiomyidae are described, the latter with male terminalia preserved in detail. In Tabanomorpha: The genus Athericites Mostovski et al. is synonymized with Palaepangonius Ren, and a new species of Galloatherix Nel is described in which the female proboscis is much longer than that of the male. All three genera were attributed to Athericidae, but the amber species reveal they are more basal tabanomorphs. Described are a new genus of stem-group Tabanoidea and a new species of Cratotabanus Martins-Neto and Kucero-Santos (Tabanidae), previously known from the Cretaceous of Brazil and New Jersey. In Nemestrinoidea: Three species of Hirmoneura Meigen are the first Nemestrinidae known from amber; one species has long cerci typical of Recent species of the genus. A new species of the Mesozoic family Rhagionemestriidae reveals this family is closely related to Acroceridae, not Xylophagidae as previously proposed. In Archisargoidea: A new species of Tethepomyiidae is described, the family known only in Cretaceous amber from New Jersey, Spain, and Myanmar. In Asiloidea: Three new species and genera of Bombyliidae are described, two of them with abdominal setal baskets distinctive to females of higher bombyliids. A fourth new asiloid genus is a probable stem-group bombyliid. The recently described Pseudorhagio Zhang et al., is transferred from Tabanomorpha to Bombyliidae. The male of a new species of Burmapsilocephala Gaimari and Mostovski (Apsilocephalidae) has terminalia very similar to that of Evocoa (Evocoidae: Recent, Chile), corroborating close relationship of the two families. In Families incertae sedis: A new species of Hilarimorphites Grimaldi and Cumming (Apystomyiidae) is described, the family known only in New Jersey and Burmese amber and the Recent fauna of California, and a sister group to either Cyclorrhapha or Eremoneura. Mysteromyiidae and Eucaudomyiidae, new families, are described, based on highly modified species with vestigial mouthparts, reduced venation, and unique specializations. Discussion is presented on some morphological features in fossil and Recent Brachycera that have apparent phylogenetic significance but are rarely discussed. This study adds further data to the phenotypic diversity, geological history, and biogeography of a major radiation.","[Grimaldi, David A.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, New York, NY 10024 USA","Grimaldi, DA (corresponding author), Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, New York, NY 10024 USA.",,,,NSF OPUS [DEB-1556502],"I am indebted to many people whose help was instrumental in this study, foremost to James Zigras for the long-term, indefinite loan to the AMNH of specimens from his superb collection.

Mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber, for example, is a proven reservoir for spectacular findings. Here we document the first record of a fossil land snail with periostracal hairs preserved in amber. We interpret the development of hairs as an adaptation to the tropical forest environment, serving as a mechanism to increase adhesion of the snail to plants during foraging while collecting and transporting seeds in the process. The present record coincides with a major global radiation of angiosperms, a main food resource for terrestrial snails. As such, the expansion of flowering plants likely triggered this evolutionary adaptation and, thus, the diversification of land snails in the Cretaceous.","[Neubauer, Thomas A.] Justus Liebig Univ, Dept Anim Ecol & Systemat, D-35392 Giessen, Germany; [Neubauer, Thomas A.] Nat Biodivers Ctr, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands; [Xing, Lida] China Univ Geosci, State Key Lab Biogeol & Environm Geol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Xing, Lida] China Univ Geosci, Sch Earth Sci & Resources, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Jochum, Adrienne] Nat Hist Museum Burgergemeinde Bern, CH-3005 Bern, Switzerland; [Jochum, Adrienne] Univ Bern, Inst Ecol & Evolut, CH-3012 Bern, Switzerland; [Jochum, Adrienne] Senckenberg Forschungsinst & Nat Museum, D-60325 Frankfurt, Germany","Neubauer, TA (corresponding author), Justus Liebig Univ, Dept Anim Ecol & Systemat, D-35392 Giessen, Germany.; Neubauer, TA (corresponding author), Nat Biodivers Ctr, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands.; Xing, LD (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, State Key Lab Biogeol & Environm Geol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.; Xing, LD (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, Sch Earth Sci & Resources, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",tneub@zo.jlug.de; xinglida@gmail.com,,"Jochum, Adrienne/0000-0002-6624-6412","German Science FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [NE 2268/2-1]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41888101, 41790455, 41772008]","We thank the German Science Foundation (NE 2268/2-1) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (41888101, 41790455, 41772008) for support; and Christoph Allgaier, Hartmut Nordsieck, Andrzej Kaim, Steffen Kiel, Alexander Nutzel, Barna Pall-Gergely, and Simon Schneider for fruitful discussions and helpful comments.",,38,7,7,0,2,CELL PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"50 HAMPSHIRE ST, FLOOR 5, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02139 USA",,2589-0042,,ISCIENCE,iScience,OCT 25,2019,20,,,,,,567,+,,10.1016/j.isci.2019.09.034,,,11,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,JI3SL,WOS:000493388000043,31611056,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2021-07-18

The latter is defined by the presence of a pterostigma in the fore wing but is otherwise morphologically heterogeneous. Mirala has a pterostigma but shares also characters with Liadopsyllidae. It is concluded that Malmopsyllidae is polyphyletic and following synonymy is proposed: Liadopsyllidae = Malmopsyllidae syn. nov.

J,"Cruickshank, RD; Ko, K",,,,"Cruickshank, RD; Ko, K",,,"Geology of an amber locality in the Hukawng Valley, northern Myanmar",JOURNAL OF ASIAN EARTH SCIENCES,,,English,Article,,,,,,Hukawng valley; southwest of Maingkwan; Lalawng village,,"Amber ('Burmite') from the Hukawng Valley of Myanmar has been known since at least the 1st century AD. It is currently being produced from a hill known as Noije Bum, which was first documented as a source of amber in 1836. Several geologists visited the locality between 1892 and 1930. All of them believed that the host rocks to the amber are Tertiary (most said Eocene) in age, and this conclusion has been widely quoted in the literature. However, recent work indicates a Cretaceous age. Insect inclusions in amber are considered to be Turonian-Cenomanian, and a specimen of the ammonite Mortoniceras (of Middle-Upper Albian age) was discovered during the authors' visit. Palynomorphs in samples collected by the authors suggest that the amber-bearing horizon is Upper Albian to Lower Cenomanian. The preponderance of the evidence suggests that both rocks and amber are most probably Upper Albian. This determination is significant for the study of insect evolution, indicating that the oldest known definitive ants have been identified in this amber [American Museum Novitates 3361 (2002) 72]. This site occurs within the Hukawng Basin, which is comprised of folded sedimentary (+/- volcanic) rocks of Cretaceous and Cenozoic age. The mine exposes a variety of clastic sedimentary rocks, with thin limestone beds, and abundant carbonaceous material. The sediments were deposited in a nearshore marine environment, such as a bay or estuary. Amber is found in a fine elastic facies, principally as disk shaped clasts, oriented parallel to bedding. A minority occurs as runnels (stalactite shaped), with concentric layering caused by recurring flows of resin. An Upper Albian age is similar to that of Orbitolina limestones known from a number of locations in northern Myanmar. One of these, at Nam Sakhaw, 90 km SW of Noije Bum, has also been a source of amber.

In the contemporary fauna, this small, relict subfamily occurs mainly in tropical and sub-tropical regions. Examination of inclusions preserved in the Upper Cretaceous amber of Myanmar (also known as Burmese amber), which is almost 100 mya, shows that this subfamily was abundant during the Cretaceous period. The extinct genus Palaeoglaesum is known only from this fossil resin. Moreover, its numerous inclusions and high diversification confirm that the Mesozoic was the stage of the early evolution and radiation of Psychodidae. Here we describe three new species and we provide additional details regarding the morphology of fossil species. Cretaceous Myanmar amber is abundant in inclusions belonging to the genus Palaeoglaesum. In addition, a significant morphological diversity among representatives of Palaeoglaesum can be observed. However, none of its representatives have been found in other fossil materials. Herein three new species: P. stebneri sp. nov., Skibinska and Krzeminski P. teres sp. nov. Skibinska and Albrycht, and P. pilosus sp. nov. Skibinska, Krzeminski and Zhang from Cretaceous Myanmar amber are described and illustrated. The very small size and characters of male hypopygium with aedeagus strongly bent and apically forked are pertinent to diagnosing the genus and species. New materials show that this genus and the whole subfamily Bruchomyiinae were probably more abundant and more diverse than the presently known extant fauna.","[Skibinska, Kornelia; Krzeminski, Wieslaw] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Systemat & Evolut Anim, Slawkowska 17, PL-31016 Krakow, Poland; [Albrycht, Marzena] Pedag Univ Krakow, Inst Biol, Podchorazych 2, PL-30084 Krakow, Poland; [Zhang, Qingqing] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qingqing] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qingqing] Univ Bonn, Inst Geosci, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Gilka, Wojciech; Zakrzewska, Marta] Univ Gdansk, Fac Biol, Dept Invertebrate Zool & Parasitol, Lab Systemat Zool, Wita Stwosza 59, PL-80308 Gdansk, Poland","Skibinska, K (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Inst Systemat & Evolut Anim, Slawkowska 17, PL-31016 Krakow, Poland.",yukisiak@gmail.com; marzena.albrycht@up.krakow.pl; qqzhang@nigpas.ac.cn; wojciech.gilka@ug.edu.pl; marta.zakrzewska@ug.edu.pl; wieslawk4@gmail.com,,"Zakrzewska, Marta/0000-0002-5125-8656; Skibinska, Kornelia/0000-0002-5971-9373; Krzeminski, Wieslaw/0000-0001-5685-891X","National Science Centre, PolandNational Science Centre, Poland [2016/23/B/NZ8/00936]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB26000000]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41688103]; Alexander von Humboldt FoundationAlexander von Humboldt Foundation","This research was funded by the National Science Centre, Poland No. 2016/23/B/NZ8/00936), the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDB26000000), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41688103).

Here we describe a foot with digital proportions unlike any previously described enantiornithine or Mesozoic bird. No bones are preserved in the new specimen but the outline of the foot is recorded in a detailed skin surface, which is surrounded by feather inclusions including a partial rachis-dominated feather. Pedal proportions and plumage support identification as an enantiornithine, but unlike previous discoveries the toes are stout with transversely elongated digital pads, and the outer toe appears strongly thickened relative to the inner two digits. The new specimen increases the known diversity and morphological disparity among the Enantiornithes, hinting at a wider range of habitats and behaviours. It also suggests that the Burmese amber avifauna was distinct from other Mesozoic assemblages, with amber entrapment including representatives from unusual small forms.","[Xing, Lida] China Univ Geosci, State Key Lab Biogeol & Environm Geol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Xing, Lida] China Univ Geosci, Sch Earth Sci & Resources, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Xing, Lida; Niu, Kecheng] Yingliang Stone Nat Hist Museum, Nanan 362300, Peoples R China; [McKellar, Ryan C.] Royal Saskatchewan Museum, Regina, SK S4P 4W7, Canada; [McKellar, Ryan C.] Univ Regina, Dept Biol, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada; [McKellar, Ryan C.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 1501 Crestline Dr Suite 140, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [O'Connor, Jingmai K.] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Paleontol & Paleoanthropol, Key Lab Vertebrate Evolut & Human Origins, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [Mai, Huijuan] Yunnan Univ, Yunnan Key Lab Palaeobiol, Kunming 650091, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Mai, Huijuan] Yunnan Univ, MEC Int Lab Palaeobiol & Palaeoenvironm, Kunming 650091, Yunnan, Peoples R China","Xing, LD (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, State Key Lab Biogeol & Environm Geol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.; Xing, LD (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, Sch Earth Sci & Resources, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.; Xing, LD (corresponding author), Yingliang Stone Nat Hist Museum, Nanan 362300, Peoples R China.; McKellar, RC (corresponding author), Royal Saskatchewan Museum, Regina, SK S4P 4W7, Canada.; McKellar, RC (corresponding author), Univ Regina, Dept Biol, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada.; McKellar, RC (corresponding author), Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 1501 Crestline Dr Suite 140, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.",xinglida@gmail.com; ryan.mckellar@gov.sk.ca,,"O'Connor, Jingmai/0000-0002-3898-8283; Xing, Lida/0000-0003-3923-9206","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41790455, 41772008]; National Geographic Society, USANational Geographic Society [EC0768-15]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2652017215]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR [2015-00681]","We thank R.

Burmese/Myanmar amber (or Burmite) from the middle Cretaceous preserves a diverse community of pseudoscorpions but these remain poorly documented, despite their exceptional preservation and potential to offer unique insights into evolutionary history. Here we describe a new genus and species of pseudoscorpion with a unique morphology of the chelicerae, Prionochthonius burmiticus gen. et sp. nov., from Burmese amber. Although some key characters remain obscure, the fossil can be confidently attributed to the basal pseudoscorpion family Chthoniidae, but it cannot be assigned to any extant or other fossil genus. Based on trichobothria patterns, it is most similar to extant genera that are found only in the Southern Hemisphere; findings that are in line with previous studies suggesting Gondwanan origins for at least some of the Burmese amber invertebrates. The fossil provides further evidence for a diverse community of litter- and soil-dwelling pseudoscorpions in the Late Cretaceous that comprises many extinct genera but represents many of the modern families. It also suggests that the diversification of chthoniid pseudoscorpions occurred well before the middle Cretaceous, and that the principle gestalt of its members has changed relatively little over time.","[Wriedt, Anna-Louisa; Kotthoff, Ulrich] Univ Hamburg, Ctr Nat Hist, Geol Paleontol Museum, Bundesstr 55, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Wriedt, Anna-Louisa; Kotthoff, Ulrich] Univ Hamburg, Inst Geol, Bundesstr 55, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Harvey, Mark S.] Western Australian Museum, Dept Terr Zool, Locked Bag 49, Welshpool Dc, WA 6986, Australia; [Harvey, Mark S.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Anim Biol, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Hammel, Joerg U.] Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Inst Mat Res, Max Planck Str 1, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany; [Hammel, Joerg U.] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Spezielle Zool & Evolut Biol, Phylet Museum, Erbertstr 1, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Wriedt, Anna-Louisa; Harms, Danilo] Univ Hamburg, Ctr Nat Hist, Zool Museum, Martin Luther King Pl 3, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany","Kotthoff, U (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Ctr Nat Hist, Geol Paleontol Museum, Bundesstr 55, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.; Kotthoff, U (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Inst Geol, Bundesstr 55, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",ulrich.kotthoff@uni-hamburg.de,"Hammel, Jorg/D-6555-2011","Hammel, Jorg/0000-0002-6744-6811","German Science FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [HA 8785/5, KO 3944/10]",We thank Carsten Grohn for access to his collections.

With description here of two new and significant taxa, Cretacoptila botosaneanui gen. et sp. nov. and Electrocentropus dilucidus gen. et sp. nov. a total of 34 named species are listed, distributed among 10 families. Several taxonomic changes are made: two established species are transferred to more-appropriate genera, becoming Neucentropus macularis (Wang et al., 2019) comb. nov. and Myanpsyche malaisei (Wichard & Wang, 2019) comb. nov.; a new extinct subfamily dagger Burminoptilinae subfamily nov. is proposed in the family Hydroptilidae and two extinct families, dagger Burmapsychidae fam. nov. and dagger Cretapsychidae fam. nov., are proposed for the superfamily Sericostomatoidea. The small size of adults of many of these species is remarkable. With their 2-4 mm length forewings they are smaller than their next relatives in the Baltic Amber and even much smaller than their present representatives. Thus, not only are the hydroptilids microcaddisflies, but also philopotamids of the genus Wormaldia and psychomyiids of the extinct genus Palerasnitsynus, which, being the most common caddisflies in Burmese amber, apparently tended to swarm.

The extremely small size and osteological development of the wings, combined with their digit proportions, strongly suggests that the remains represent precocial hatchlings of enantiornithine birds. These specimens demonstrate that the plumage types associated with modern birds were present within single individuals of Enantiornithes by the Cenomanian (99 million years ago), providing insights into plumage arrangement and microstructure alongside immature skeletal remains.

Morazatermes krishnai Engel and Deletes, new genus and species, is described from an imago (and wings of a second specimen) preserved in fossiliferous resin from Moraza, Burgos Province. A second termite species, Cantabritermes simplex Engel and Deletes, new genus and species, is also recorded from the same deposits but is presently known only from the forewing. Similarly, an isolated forewing in amber from San Just, Teruel Province is described as Aragonitermes teruelensis Engel and Deletes, new genus and species. Lastly, the first termite in Late Cretaceous (Campanian) amber from Grassy Lake, near Medicine Hat, Canada is described from a fragmentary imago lacking wings or much of the body. All of these taxa belong to a primitive grade of unassigned termites between Mastotermitidae and the families Termopsidae, Hodotermitidae, and Archotermopsidae (sensu Engel et al., 2009). Notes are appended on the recently described Kalotermes burmensis Poinar, from the latest Albian of Myanmar (Burmese amber), and the species transferred to Kachinitermopsis Engel and Deletes, new genus, resulting in the new combination, Kachinitermopsis burmensis.

Recent relaxed molecular clock based studies introduced the hypothesis that the diversity of these liverworts expanded during the Cretaceous Terrestrial Revolution (KTR) period around 125-80 Ma. Until now, the fossil record provides only insufficient support to elucidate this hypothesis. Here, we describe a new inclusion of Porellales within mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber as Frullania partita sp. nov. (Frullaniaceae). It is characterized by apically apiculate leaf lobes, helmet-shaped to campanulate water sacs situated in some distance to stem, lanceolate styli, and apically deeply bilobed underleaves carrying rhizoid bundles in their basal parts. This new discovery contributes our understandings for the diversity aspects of Frullaniaceae (Porellales) of Burmese amber inclusions. The bark fragments connected to the branch provide the evidence that the fossil was an epiphyte. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The remarkable preservation of these delicate structures in amber implies a potential for significantly improving our knowledge of feather evolution and diversity. A large sample set of 150 Burmese amber specimens (Upper Cretaceous, similar to 99 Ma) containing feathers is herein described. Several structural types can be differentiated, including flight feathers, contour feathers, semiplumes, and filoplumes. In some cases, peculiar pigmentation patterns and structural features can be documented. Additionally, different developmental stages have been captured in this assemblage with some examples of erupting feathers or neoptile plumage.

They are provisionally not attributed to a precise subfamily. The female of Paleocytherea pouilloni has terminalia modified into a very wide chamber with acanthophorite spines on tergites 9 + 10 and a row of ventral setae evocating a specialized hair brush. These structures allowed digging into sand to lay eggs, and possibly would characterize a sand chamber similar to those of several extant Bombyliidae that use it to coat eggs with sand and attack ground-dwelling insects. Eggs are wrapped with sand, avoiding dessication and/or direct competition with more efficient parasitoids, including wasps. This discovery suggests a potential great antiquity for this behavior (e.g., potential competitors like angarosphecid wasps are recorded in Burmese amber). Potential bee fly hosts were antlions, pygmy mole crickets, and the earliest bees, also known in the Burmese amber. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

B. compactus is the oldest amber inclusion of a net-winged beetle. The discovery suggests the start of Lycidae diversification at least in the Mid-Cretaceous. The fossil was discovered in the area of the highest phylogenetic diversity of extant net-winged beetles, in deposits with a rich beetles fauna. The species is a member of the putative early radiation of this family and shows relationships with Afrotropical Dexorinae from which it differs in the dilated apical palpomeres, serrate antennae, and fully metamorphosed females. Burmolycus compactus shares 10-segmented antennae with several genera with proved or hypothesized neotenic females. The general appearance of Cretaceous B. compactus is surprisingly similar to extant net-winged beetles and may represent the example of their long-term morphological stasis. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

NOV.; PHYLOGENY; ODONATOPTERA; CHARACTERS; ZYGOPTERA; EPHEMEROPTERA; MORPHOLOGY,"The fossil record of dragonfly relatives (Odonatoptera) dates back to the Carboniferous, yet knowledge about these extinct animals is meagre. For most of the species little is known except for the characteristics of the wing venation. As a result, it is difficult to include fossil larvae in a (wing character based) phylogenetic tree as the wing venation is not visible in most of the larval instars. Two larval specimens from Cretaceous Burmese amber are in the focus of this study. The two specimens likely represent two subsequent early stage larval instars of the same individual Not only is this an exceptional case to study ontogenetic processes in fossils - the larval instars are morphologically completely different from all known larvae of Odonata with respect to the posterior abdominal region. Therefore, besides the difficulties regarding the phylogenetic interpretation and though all Burmese amber odonatans are known from adults only, a new species - Arcanodraco filitauda n. sp. - is formally described. Aside from likely representing a new species, the morphology of the posterior abdominal region is highly informative for reconstructing the character evolution within the lineage towards modern dragonflies and damselflies. A long median process in both of the fossils meets all criteria to be interpreted as a terminal filum (structure or derivative of tergite of abdominal segment 11, annulated in one of the specimens). Although the exact phylogenetic affinity of Arcamodnico filitauda n. sp. remains enigmatic, the presence of a larval terminal filum can be reconstructed for the ground pattern of Odonatoptera (including its direct stem lineage).","[Schaedel, Mario; Haug, Joachim T.] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Biol, Grosshaderner Str 2, Planegg Martinsried 82152, Germany; [Mueller, Patrick] Friedhofstr 9, Kashofen 66894, Germany; [Haug, Joachim T.] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, GeoBio Ctr, Richard Wagner Str 10, Munich 80333, Germany","Schadel, M (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Biol, Grosshaderner Str 2, Planegg Martinsried 82152, Germany.",mario.schaedel@palaeo-evo-devo.info; pat14789@web.de; joachim.haug@palaeo-evo-devo.info,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [Ha 6300/3-2]; Volkswagen Foundation (Lichtenberg professorship),"We are grateful to Andre Nel (MNHN, Paris) and Ilaria Mazzini (associate editor) for their valuable comments which helped to improve the manuscript.

These specimens have improved our knowledge based on compression fossils in Cretaceous sedimentary rocks, adding details of three-dimensional structure and soft tissues that are rarely preserved elsewhere. Here we describe a remarkably well-preserved foot, accompanied by part of the wing plumage. These body parts were likely dismembered, entering the resin due to predatory or scavenging behaviour by a larger animal. The new specimen preserves contour feathers on the pedal phalanges together with enigmatic scutellae scale filament (SSF) feathers on the foot, providing direct analogies to the plumage patterns observed in modern birds, and those cultivated through developmental manipulation studies. Ultimately, this connection may allow researchers to observe how filamentous dinosaur ` protofeathers' developed-testing theories using evolutionary holdovers in modern birds.","[Xing, Lida] China Univ Geosci, State Key Lab Biogeol & Environm Geol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Xing, Lida] China Univ Geosci, Sch Earth Sci & Resources, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [McKellar, Ryan C.] Royal Saskatchewan Museum, Regina, SK S4P 4W7, Canada; [McKellar, Ryan C.] Univ Regina, Biol Dept, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada; [McKellar, Ryan C.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 1501 Crestline Dr,Suite 140, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [O'Connor, Jingmai K.] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Paleontol & Paleoanthropol, Key Lab Vertebrate Evolut & Human Origins, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [Bai, Ming] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Tseng, Kuowei] Univ Taipei, Dept Exercise & Hlth Sci, Taipei 11153, Taiwan; [Chiappe, Luis M.] Nat Hist Museum Los Angeles Cty, Dinosaur Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA","McKellar, RC (corresponding author), Royal Saskatchewan Museum, Regina, SK S4P 4W7, Canada.; McKellar, RC (corresponding author), Univ Regina, Biol Dept, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada.; McKellar, RC (corresponding author), Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 1501 Crestline Dr,Suite 140, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.; O'Connor, JK (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Paleontol & Paleoanthropol, Key Lab Vertebrate Evolut & Human Origins, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China.",ryan.mckellar@gov.sk.ca; jingmai@ivpp.ac.cn,,"Xing, Lida/0000-0003-3923-9206","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR [2015-00681]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41790455, 41772008, 31672345]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2652017215]; National Geographic SocietyNational Geographic Society [EC0768-15]; Scientific Research Equipment Development Project of Chinese Academy of Sciences [YZ201509]","We thank Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BL13W1) for beam time access based on proposal 15ssrf00730.

NOV.; SP. NOV.; NOM REV; N. GEN.; MICROORGANISMS,"Early endosymbiotic interactions are recorded only from a Cretaceous termite and a cockroach. Mesoblatta maxi Hinkelman, gen. et sp. nov. is the second representative of the dominant, cosmopolitan Mesozoic family Mesoblattinidae known from Cenomanian northern Myanmar amber, and the fourteenth from both amber and sedimentary rocks. Unique characters are rare (n = 19), symplesiomorphies are frequent (n = 140), and foremost is a standard maxillary palp, an irregular area between forewing veins radius and media, central ocellus, and multisegmented styli, suggesting an ancestral position with respect to Blattidae. Autapomorphies of this otherwise conservative taxon are only its large size and a short probasitarsus. Two nymphs with fecal pellets protruding from their body, Blattocoprolites mesoblattamaxi Hinkelman, ichogen. et ichnosp. nov., represent the first cockroaches with formalized coprolites (along with Blattocoprolites blattulidae Hinkelman, ichnosp. nov. established herein from Lebanese amber) and provide evidence of burial defecation. Subhomogenic consistency of coprolites with mucous components, pseudoinclusions, leaf, trichia, wood debris, cycad pollen, endosymbiotic protists, and epibiotic bacteria directly document pollen transfer through the digestive tract and the earliest coevolution with protists and bacteria. Other post-burial fecal bacteria at the surface are documented for the first time in the Mesozoic, directly indicating structured dung processing. Reference samples (as well as almost all Myanmar amber samples) contain numerous pseudoinclusions, probably representing damaged or dead cysts of Chlamydomonas hanublikanus Vrsanska et Hinkelman, sp. nov. established on the basis of its reproductive stages (with an origin within the resin inside the tree). These are documented together with green algae, including Spirogyra Nees, 1820; flagellates; and flagellate amoebae, promoting massive future microbiota studies.","[Hinkelman, Jan] Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Dubravska Cesta 9, Bratislava 84506, Slovakia; [Vrsanska, Lucia] Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Earth Sci, Dubravska Cesta 9, Bratislava 84005, Slovakia; [Vrsanska, Lucia] AMBA Projekty, Ticha 4, Bratislava 81102, Slovakia","Hinkelman, J (corresponding author), Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Dubravska Cesta 9, Bratislava 84506, Slovakia.",jan.hinkelman@savba.sk; luciavrsanska12@gmail.com,,,Slovak Research and Development AgencySlovak Research and Development Agency [APVV-0436-12]; UNESCO-Amba/MVTS of the Slovak Academy of Sciences;  [VEGA 2/0042/18],This work was supported by the Slovak Research and Development Agency under the contracts no.

In this paper, we present the results of a study of a much larger and more diverse selection of Burmese amber weevils. We prepared all amber blocks to maximise visibility of structures and examined these with high-magnification light microscopy as well as CT scanning (selected specimens). We redescribe most previously described taxa and describe 52 new species in 26 new genera, accompanied by photographs. We compare critical characters of these weevils with those of extant taxa and outline the effects of distortion on their preservation and interpretation. We conclude that only two weevil families are thus far represented in Burmese amber, Nemonychidae and a newly recognised family, Mesophyletidae, which appears closely related to Attelabidae but cannot be accommodated in this family. The geniculate antennae and long rostrum with exodont mandibles of most Mesophyletidae indicate that they were highly specialised phytophages of early angiosperms preserved in the amber, likely ovipositing in flowers or seeds. This weevil fauna appears to represent an extinct mid-Cretaceous ecosystem and fills a critical gap in the fossil record of weevils.","[Clarke, Dave J.; McKenna, Duane D.] Univ Memphis, Dept Biol Sci, 3700 Walker Ave, Memphis, TN 38152 USA; [Limaye, Ajay] Australian Natl Univ, Natl Computat Infrastruct, 143 Ward Rd, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Oberprieler, Rolf G.] Australian Natl Insect Collect, CSIRO, GPO Box 1700, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia","Clarke, DJ (corresponding author), Univ Memphis, Dept Biol Sci, 3700 Walker Ave, Memphis, TN 38152 USA.; Oberprieler, RG (corresponding author), Australian Natl Insect Collect, CSIRO, GPO Box 1700, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",djclarke@memphis.edu; Ajay.Limaye@anu.edu.au; dmckenna@memphis.edu; rolf.oberprieler@csiro.au,"Oberprieler, Rolf G./B-3733-2009","McKenna, Duane/0000-0002-7823-8727",US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB1355169]; Strategic Priority Research Program (B) of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB26000000],"D.J.C.'s research was supported by the US National Science Foundation grant #DEB1355169 (to Duane McKenna), and the Strategic Priority Research Program (B) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (grant XDB26000000 to BoWang) supported the acquisition of specimens.",,97,20,22,0,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,1424-2818,,DIVERSITY-BASEL,Diversity-Basel,JAN,2019,11,1,,,,,,,1,10.3390/d11010001,,,219,Biodiversity Conservation; Ecology,Biodiversity & Conservation; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,HM8OM,WOS:000459740700001,,DOAJ Gold,,,2021-07-18

From its broad and flat habitus, the lack of a pronoto-elytral angle, the short and broad head, the short mesoventrite, and the lancet-shaped elongate prosternal process it resembles beetles belonging to the aquatic Dytiscoidea. The metacoxal plates are similar to those of Noteridae. However, pubescent antennal flagellomeres, an anisochaetous protibial antenna cleaner, transversely oriented metepimera, and metacoxae not reaching beyond the lateral margin of the metaventrite identify the fossil as an atypical species of Carabidae. Externally closed procoxal cavities, lacking procoxal rests of the mesoventrite, a narrow mesepimeron not reaching the mesocoxal cavity, and lobate metepimera indicate a placement in a clade comprising Harpalinae and Brachininae. This is supported by analyses of morphological data and a Hennigian character evaluation. The short and transverse head, the streamlined body without pronoto-elytral angle, and the secondarily elongated prosternal process suggest a placement as stem group member of the specialized Pseudomorphini. In contrast to species of the crown group of this lineage, a distinct submento-mental suture is present, ventral cephalic antennal grooves are missing, and the elytra are not truncated posteriorly. The fossil is the first record for Pseudomorphini and documents an origin of this specialized group of Carabidae at least dating back to the Cretaceous. A superficial similarity with the extant migadopine genus Stichonotus (e.g. broad and oval body, apically pointed prosternal process) is the result of convergence. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The subfamily is monotypic with a single genus Buchonomyia, including three Recent species from Europe, South-East Asia and Central America, and a single fossil species, B. succinea Seredszus and Wichard, 2002, from Baltic amber. The elusive nature of the larvae and pupae, who develop as parasites or are commensal of caddisfly larvae, means that records of recent Buchonomyiinae extremely rare. From the latest dated phylogeny of the Chironomidae, the Buchonomyiinae branched from the rest of the Chironomidae in the Early to Middle Jurassic. Here we present the oldest record of the subfamily Buchonomyiinae, from Upper Cretaceous Burmese amber. The record is represented by a new genus Furcobuchonomyia, with a single species E saetheri sp. nov. Bayesian analysis firmly places the new genus as the sister group to the rest of the Buchonomyiinae. Thus the discovery of this genus is shedding new light on the origin of the most basal group of the Chironomidae. A species level key to the subfamily is included. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we describe a new cyclaxyrid genus and species, Pacyclaxyra azari gen. et sp. nov., from mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber mined in northern Myanmar (ca. 99 Ma). The new genus is separated from all other cyclaxyrids by its unusually large body size, dorsally concealed antennal insertions, narrowly separated procoxae, narrow prosternal process not expanded at apex, and presence of a distinct discrimen on metaventrite. Together with Electroxyra cretacea described from the same deposit, Pacyclaxyra gen. nov. represents the earliest sooty mould beetle in the fossil record.

(2019) recently described two new species of gastropods from the Cretaceous Burmese amber and attributed them to the marine family Epitoniidae. A close inspection of the images provided by Yu et al. indicates however that the species in question do not belong to that family or any marine gastropod group. In contrast, the two species are attributed here to the terrestrial operculate family Pupinidae (Cyclophoroidea) and tentatively to the genus Pseudopomatias. We briefly review the fossil record of the Cyclophoroidea and Pupinidae and discuss implications of the present revision. After all, Pseudopomatias? lyui (Yu, Wang and Jarzembowski, 2019) and P.? zhuoi (Yu, Wang and Jarzembowski, 2019) belong to the oldest members of the Pupinidae.

Five of them have unusually modified mouthparts with a strongly transformed labium, which shows features interpreted as adaptations to suctorial feeding. Among the hyperdiverse Coleoptera, similar feeding adaptations are known only in several genera of Cerylonidae and Leiodidae. Fossils attributed to Eucinetidae or representing taxa presumably closely related to eucinetids are known from Lower Cretaceous of China and Upper Jurassic of Mongolia, but none of them shows modified mouthparts. The first fossil of a 'suctorial eucinetid', dagger Cretohlezkus alleni gen. et sp. nov., is reported in the present paper, based on a well-preserved specimen in Cenomanian Burmese amber. A preliminary phylogenetic analysis placed dagger Cretohlezkus near base of the monophyletic 'suctorial eucinetid' lineage, but branch support was too low to present a robust evolutionary hypothesis. The prementum of dagger Cretohlezkus is modified as strongly as that of extant members of this group, demonstrating early origins of still only speculative feeding habits of the 'suctorial eucinetids', which presumably use Myxomycetes or Basidiomycetes as the source of food.

This is particularly true for the early flies (lower Diptera) which underwent rapid radiation during the Cretaceous period. Here we describe a remarkable nematocerous fossil fly which shows a character typical of the flies of the suborder Brachycera-with strongly modified antenna-representing new evidence that such a Brachycera-like modification of the antennae has evolved several times during the evolutionary history of Diptera. A new fossil genus of Bibionidae (Diptera: Bibionomorpha), Burmahesperinus gen. nov., from the mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber, is described and illustrated (type species Burmahesperinus antennatus sp. nov., the other two species included are B. conicus sp. nov. and B. pedicellatus sp. nov.). The new genus is tentatively placed in a new subfamily, Burmahesperininae subfam. nov. of the family Bibionidae. Its possible phylogenetic position is briefly discussed. The new genus, as well as the subfamily, possesses the wing venation similar to the recent genus Hesperinus Walker, 1848, in combination with Brachycera-like modification of both the male and female antenna and the overall habitus typical of fungus gnats (Sciaroidea).","[Sevcik, Jan] Univ Ostrava, Dept Biol & Ecol, Fac Sci, Chittussiho 10, Ostrava 71000, Czech Republic; [Skartveit, John] NLA Univ Coll Bergen, Dept Teacher Educ, POB 74 Sandviken, N-5812 Bergen, Norway; [Krzeminski, Wieslaw; Skibinska, Kornelia] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Systemat & Evolut Anim, Slawkowska 17, PL-31016 Krakow, Poland","Sevcik, J (corresponding author), Univ Ostrava, Dept Biol & Ecol, Fac Sci, Chittussiho 10, Ostrava 71000, Czech Republic.",sevcikjan@hotmail.com; John.Skartveit@NLA.no; wieslawk4@gmail.com; yukisiak@gmail.com,,"Skibinska, Kornelia/0000-0002-5971-9373; Sevcik, Jan/0000-0001-7174-593X; Krzeminski, Wieslaw/0000-0001-5685-891X","National Science Centre of PolandNational Science Centre, Poland [UMO2016/23/B/NZ8/00936]","This research was funded by National Science Centre of Poland (grant number UMO2016/23/B/NZ8/00936) and by the institutional support for the University of Ostrava provided by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic.",,33,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-4450,,INSECTS,Insects,APR,2021,12,4,,,,,,,364,10.3390/insects12040364,,,11,Entomology,Entomology,RR4LC,WOS:000643070800001,33923888,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2021-07-18

According to the morphology of fossil forms this seems to have been the case already in the Early Cretaceous. While being predators, lacewing larvae are also food items for other organisms. Here we report two pieces of amber from Myanmar providing instances of such cases. In one amber piece several isolated stylets of lacewing larvae are preserved closely associated together. The most likely interpretation is that a predator preying on lacewing larvae has regurgitated or defecated these non-digestible pieces, yet the identity of the predator remains unclear. The other amber piece preserves a larva resembling modem day larvae of split-footed lacewings (Nymphidae). The larva has projections on its trunk, allowing it to wear a camouflaging cloak. In the head region, a mite (Acari) is attached to the larva; more precisely, the entire anterior body region of the mite is apparently inserted into the lacewing larva. The mite is smaller than the larva. It is known from the modern fauna that stage 1 larvae of Ascalaphidae can be attacked also by rather small predators, such as ants. The mite can therefore well be interpreted as a true predator instead of a parasite, especially considering the unusual mode of attachment. We briefly review interactions of lacewing larvae with other organisms represented in amber from Myanmar and add two new pieces to the puzzle of reconstructing the trophic interactions in the 100-million-year old amber forest.","[Hoernig, Marie; Kiesmuller, Christine] Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Zool Inst & Museum, Cytol & Evolutionary Biol, Soldmannstr 23, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany; [Mueller, Patrick] Friedhofstr 9, D-66894 Kashofen, Germany; [Haug, Carolin; Haug, Joachim] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen LMU, Bioctr, Grosshaderner Str 2, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany; [Haug, Carolin; Haug, Joachim] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, GeoBio Ctr, Richart Wagner Str 10, D-80333 Munich, Germany","Hornig, M (corresponding author), Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Zool Inst & Museum, Cytol & Evolutionary Biol, Soldmannstr 23, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany.",marie.hoernig@palaeo-evo-devo.info; pat14789@web.de; carolin.haug@palaeo-evo-devo.info,,"Kiesmuller, Christine/0000-0002-4961-6565",Volkswagen FoundationVolkswagen; Landesgraduiertenforderung Mecklenburg-Vorpommern,"We highly appreciate the effort of all people involved in providing open access, open source and low cost software.

Gackstroemia cretacea is the first fossil record of Lepidolaenaceae, a family being at the present time confined to the southern temperate zone.

Split-footed lacewings nowadays are restricted to Australasia, while fossil forms are also known from other areas of the world, indicating that the group was more species-rich and therefore likely diverse in the past. Split-footed lacewings have rather distinct larvae, roughly resembling antlion larvae, but differing from the latter especially with regard to the mandibles. Antlion larvae usually have three prominent teeth on each mandible, while at least extant larvae of split-footed lacewings only have a single prominent tooth per mandible. Fossils interpreted as larvae of split-footed lacewings are well known from amber from Myanmar (ca. 100 myr; Burmese amber) and by a single specimen from Baltic amber (about 40 myr). We here report additional fossil specimens from Myanmar amber, expanding the known record of fossil forms from six depicted specimens to 15. For the extant fauna, we could compile 25 larvae. We compare the diversity of shape of extant and fossil larvae through time using an outline analysis (based on elliptic Fourier transformation) of the head. The results of this analysis indicate that the morphological diversity, or disparity, of split-footed lacewing larvae was higher in the past than it is today. With this type of analysis, we can show a loss of diversity over time, without the necessity to identify the fossil larvae down to a narrow taxonomical range. A similar pattern has already been recognised in silky lacewings, Psychopsidae. This might indicate a general loss of diversity of lacewing larvae.","[Haug, Gideon T.; Haug, Carolin; van der Wal, Serita; Haug, Joachim T.] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen LMU Munich, Bioctr, Grosshaderner Str 2, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany; [Haug, Carolin; Haug, Joachim T.] GeoBio Ctr LMU, Richard Wagner Str 10, D-80333 Munich, Germany","Haug, JT (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen LMU Munich, Bioctr, Grosshaderner Str 2, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany.; Haug, JT (corresponding author), GeoBio Ctr LMU, Richard Wagner Str 10, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",joachim.haug@palaeo-evo-devo.info,,,Volkswagen FoundationVolkswagen; LMUexcellent Junior Researcher Fund; Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD)Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD) [91693832]; LMU Munich,"We thank two anonymous reviewers and the Editor-in-Chief Mike Reich for helpful comments.

Here, we report two new species Acalyptomerus thayerae sp. nov. and Sphaerothorax uenoi sp. nov., both belonging to extant genera of Clambidae, from mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber. Acalyptomerus thayerae has a close affinity to A. herbertfranzi, a species currently occurring in Mesoamerica and northern South America. Sphaerothorax uenoi is closely related to extant species of Sphaerothorax, which are usually collected in forests of Nothofagus of Australia, Chile, and New Zealand. The discovery of two Cretaceous species from northern Myanmar indicates that both genera had lengthy evolutionary histories, originated at least by the earliest Cenomanian, and were probably more widespread than at present. Remarkable morphological similarities between fossil and living species suggest that both genera changed little over long periods of geological time. The long-term persistence of similar mesic microhabitats such as leaf litter may account for the 99 Myr morphological stasis in Acalyptomerus and Sphaerothorax. Additionally, the extinct staphylinoid family Ptismidae is proposed as a new synonym of Clambidae, and its only included species Ptisma zasukhae is placed as incertae sedis within Clambidae.","[Cai, Chenyang] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, CAS Key Lab Econ Stratig & Palaeogeog, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Huang, Diying] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Cai, Chenyang] Univ Bristol, Sch Earth Sci, Life Sci Bldg,Tyndall Ave, Bristol BS8 1TQ, Avon, England; [Lawrence, John F.; Slipinski, Adam] CSIRO, Australian Natl Insect Collect, GPO Box 1700, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Yamamoto, Shuhei; Newton, Alfred F.] Field Museum Nat Hist, Integrat Res Ctr, 1400 S Lake Shore Dr, Chicago, IL 60605 USA; [Leschen, Richard A.

Many polyneopteran insects with euplantulae, for example, Grylloblattodea, Mantophasmatodea and Orthoptera, have been described from the Mesozoic. However, the origin and evolution of stick insects' euplantulae are poorly understood due to rare fossil records. Here, we report the earliest fossil records of Timematodea hitherto, Tumefactipes prolongates gen. et sp. nov. and Granosicorpes lirates gen. et sp. nov., based on three specimens from mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber. Specimens of Tumefactipes prolongates gen. et sp. nov. have extremely specialized and expanded euplantulae on their tarsomere II. These new findings are the first known and the earliest fossil records about euplantula structure within Phasmatodea, demonstrating the diversity of euplantulae in Polyneoptera during the Mesozoic. Such tarsal pads might have increased friction and helped these mid-Cretaceous stick insects to climb more firmly on various surfaces, such as broad leaves, wetted tree branches or ground. These specimens provide more morphological data for us to understand the relationships of Timematodea, Euphasmatodea, Orthoptera and Embioptera, suggesting that Timematodea might be monophyletic with Euphasmatodea rather than Embioptera and Phasmatodea should have a closer relationship with Orthoptera rather than Embioptera.","[Chen, Sha; Shih, Chungkun; Ren, Dong; Gao, Tai-Ping] Capital Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, 105 Xisanhuanbeilu, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China; [Deng, Shi-Wo; Zhang, Peng; Zhu, Yi-Ning] Capital Normal Univ, Sch Math Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Shih, Chungkun] Smithsonian Inst, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Dept Paleobiol, Washington, DC 20560 USA; [Zhang, Wei-Wei] POB 4680, Chongqing, Peoples R China","Zhu, YN; Gao, TP (corresponding author), Capital Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, 105 Xisanhuanbeilu, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China.",ynzhu@cnu.edu.cn; tpgao@cnu.edu.cn,"Gao, Taiping/Z-3987-2019","Gao, Taiping/0000-0002-8118-8708","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31730087, 41688103, 31672323]; Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in UniversityProgram for Changjiang Scholars & Innovative Research Team in University (PCSIRT) [IRT-17R75]; Support Project of High-level Teachers in Beijing Municipal Universities in the Period of 13th Five-year Plan [IDHT20180518]; Young Elite Scientist Sponsorship Program by CAST; Beijing Natural Science FoundationBeijing Natural Science Foundation [5182004]; Youth Innovative Research Team of Capital Normal University","We are grateful to Dr. Michael S.

There are 18 new species in 15 genera (11 of them new) and four families plus the Syrphoidea. Fossils are from the Early Cretaceous of Lebanon, Late Cretaceous of New Jersey (United States) and Alberta (Canada), Eocene of the eastern Baltic coast, and Miocene of the Dominican Republic, but predominantly from the mid-Cretaceous of Myanmar. Stem-group Lonchopteroidea are Alonchoptera lebanica, n. gen., n. sp., and Lonchopterites burmensis, n. sp. Platypezidae include the stem groups Burmapeza radicis, n. gen., n. sp., Canadopeza biacrosticha, n. gen., n. sp., and Calvopeza divergens, n. gen., n. sp. An unnamed Microsania sp. is the first definitive Platypezidae in Baltic amber; Lebanopeza azari, n. gen., n. sp., is a stem group to the Microsaniinae and Melanderomyiinae. Chandleromyia anomala, n. gen., n. sp., is an anomalously derived Platypezinae from the Cretaceous, and two new species of the diverse Recent genus Lindneromyia are in Dominican amber (L. neomedialis and L. dominicana). Fossils of the relict family Ironomyiidae (with 3 living species from eastern Australia) include two stem-group genera with two new species each, all in Burmese amber: Palaeopetia dorsalis and P. terminus, Proironia (n. gen.) gibbera and P. burmitica. All other species of Palaeopetia are compression fossils from the Cretaceous of Asia and Eurasia. For Phoridae, a new defining feature is a stridulatum on the procoxa and profemur in both sexes, occuring in most fossil taxa where observable. New sciadocerines include Eosciadocera pauciseta, n. sp., a very large species in Baltic amber, and two stem groups in Burmese amber, Prophora dimorion, n. gen., n. sp., and a very small, undescribed taxon. Archiphora pria Grimaldi and Cumming in Turonian-aged New Jersey amber is transferred to Hennigophora Brown, based on evidence from a new specimen. Prioriphorinae (not taxonomically treated here) is a paraphyletic, Cretaceous grade to the very diverse, crown-group radiation of Euphorida that occurred in the Cenozoic. Two syrphoids occur in Burmese amber: Prosyrphus thompsoni, n. gen., n. sp. (an apparent stem group to the Syrphidae), and Aschizomyia burmensis, n. gen., n. sp. (with more ambiguous affinities). Several immatures of undetermined family are reported, one a probable phorid larva. No definitive Schizophora are yet known from the Cretaceous.","[Grimaldi, David A.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, New York, NY 10024 USA","Grimaldi, DA (corresponding author), Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, New York, NY 10024 USA.",,,,U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [OPUS DEB-1556502],"I am indebted to various people and sources of support for the completion of this work.

Balatronis cretacea gen. et sp. nov. from the Cenomanian burmite is the most ancient member of the type cockroach family Blattidae and the only one recorded from Cretaceous strata. Individuals represented by immature and adults (n = 14, 4) constitute 3.2 per cents of all Myanmar amber cockroaches surveyed by us indicating habits close to source trees supported with bark body pattern (absent in sedimentary fossils). Preservation in small-sized pieces suggests longer post-depositional transportation. Its characteristic aposematic coloration suggests direct ancestry to the living repellent harlequin cockroach Neostylopyga rhombifolia, which lost its wings. Along with the bizarre Manipulatoridae, Eadiidae and Alienopteridae species, it exemplifies the high disparity of cockroaches in the ancient amber-producing tropical forest, but also documents the appearance of advanced modern taxa.

The laterally compressed spikelet of P. burmitis has two basal sterile glumes, a series of lemmas and paleas and remains of stamens and a gynoecium. Adjacent to the spikelet are spherical, monoporate pollen grains. The epidermis of the leaf fragment of P. laminatus contains numerous stomata with well-defined, sausage-shaped guard cells with elongate nuclei, rows of epidermal cells with long and short cells and spherical and elliptical silica-like bodies in cuboid epidermal cells. Unpointed papillae and uniseriate bicellular microhairs, both raised, occur on the leaf surface. Programinis burmitis and P. laminatus are considered early bambusoid types that grew in tropical, forested habitats.

Direct fossil evidence is lacking for this group. Here, I describe the first fossil of this peculiar subfamily, Protodasycerus aenigmaticus gen. and sp. n., from the Upper Cretaceous Burmese amber. Despite considerable external similarities to extant dasycerine species, this new genus possesses several important morphological differences: a much smaller body size (ca. 1.1 mm), narrowly elongate antennomeres 1 and 2, not strongly transverse metaventrite, elytra striate but not tricostate, and truncate posterior margin of the elytra exposing four abdominal tergites dorsally. The new finding of a Cretaceous representative of the Dasycerinae helps elucidate the origin and early evolution of the omaliine group subfamilies, implying rather close similarities between the Dasycerinae and the monobasic subfamily Neophoninae. Discovery of P. aenigmaticus suggests a rather ancient origin of the subfamily by the Upper Cretaceous. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Planidia of a similar conicocephalate form are known from the slightly younger amber of western Canada (Campanian) as well as in the earlier (Cenomanian) amber of Myanmar, and comparisons are made with those fossils, as well as with living Strepsiptera and the beetle family Ripiphoridae (Tenebrionoidea). Given recent debate concerning the strepsipteran attribution of these planidia, we provide some discussion about the available and expected character evidence, and tend to believe assignment to Ripiphoridae is untenable.

Various groups of fossil flies (Diptera) belong to the most abundant insects found in these fossil resins indicating that it was the Mesozoic when the early evolution and radiation of Diptera took place. Here we describe a remarkable fossil fly which combines characters of various other related flies from different families (both extant and fossil) in a very unusual way. This new genus is tentatively placed in the family Keroplatidae (the so called predaceous fungus gnats) pending and stimulating further research into the evolution of lower Diptera. A new fossil genus and species of Keroplatidae (Diptera, Bibionomorpha, Sciaroidea),Adamacrocera adamigen. et sp. nov., from the Upper Cretaceous Burmese amber is described and illustrated. Based on morphological evidence, it is placed in a new subfamily Adamacrocerinae subfam. nov. The new genus, as well as the subfamily, possesses the wing venation characteristic of the genera of some Sciaroidea incertae sedis, as well as that of the fossil families Archizelmiridae, Antefungivoridae and Mesosciophilidae, in combination with macrocerine-like habitus and male terminalia.","[Sevcik, Jan] Univ Ostrava, Fac Sci, Dept Biol & Ecol, Chittussiho 10, Ostrava 71000, Czech Republic; [Krzeminski, Wieslaw] Pedag Univ Krakow, Inst Biol, Podbrzezie 3, PL-31054 Krakow, Poland; [Skibinska, Kornelia] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Systemat & Evolut Anim, PL-31016 Krakow, Poland","Skibinska, K (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Inst Systemat & Evolut Anim, PL-31016 Krakow, Poland.",sevcikjan@hotmail.com; wieslawk4@gmail.com; yukisiak@gmail.com,,"Sevcik, Jan/0000-0001-7174-593X; Skibinska, Kornelia/0000-0002-5971-9373","National Science Centre of PolandNational Science Centre, Poland [UMO-2016/23/B/NZ8/00936]","This research was funded by the National Science Centre of Poland (grant number UMO-2016/23/B/NZ8/00936) and by the institutional support for the University of Ostrava provided by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic.",,43,2,5,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-4450,,INSECTS,Insects,SEP,2020,11,9,,,,,,,552,10.3390/insects11090552,,,9,Entomology,Entomology,OE1PZ,WOS:000580312700001,32825188,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2021-07-18

At the same time, Burmella gen. nov. clearly differs from Vietnamella by a diminished number of longitudinal and cross veins in the hind wings, and by the different shape of male genitalia.

Burmese (Myanmar) amber checklist and bibliography 2018. Palaeoentomology 2(1): 22-84) and Eocene European ambers (Wunderlich J. 2004. Fossil spiders in amber and copal: conclusions, revisions, new taxa and family diagnoses of fossil and extant taxa. Hirschberg-Leutershausen: Ed. Joerg Wunderlich, 1893 p.). They have been known to occur in Oise amber (Ypresian, early Eocene, MP7), from northern France. However, they are not abundant in Oise amber, and have been the subject of few studies until now. Here, we describe the only well-preserved, almost complete, archaeid fossil specimen. This adult male is described as Myrmecarchaea antecessor sp. nov, based on the presence of unique morphological features. The elongate petiolus and extremely long legs are characteristic of the genus Myrmecarchaea from the Middle Eocene Baltic amber. However, unique traits such as the thick, stout petiolus and the extremely elongated, posteriorly tapering cephalothorax distinguish it from the other species of Myrmecarchaea. This specimen is of high interest, as besides being a new species, it is also the first documented adult male in the genus, allowing us to observe sexual characters for the first time. Furthermore, it is the first occurrence of this genus outside Baltic amber, showing affinities between Oise and Baltic ambers, which are, otherwise, very different in their faunistic compositions, and further extends the known past range of the archaeid spiders. Actuellement, les Archaeidae, connues sous les noms communs d'araignees-pelicans ou araignees-assassins, ont une distribution australe (Afrique du Sud, Madagascar, Australie), mais peuplaient l'Eurasie durant le Mesozoique et le Cenozoique, comme l'attestent les fossiles de l'ambre du Cretace de Birmanie (Ross A. 2019.

Ce male adulte est decrit ici comme Myrmecarchaea antecessor sp. nov., sur la base de caracteres morphologiques uniques. Le pedicelle allonge et les pattes extremement longues sont caracteristiques du genre Myrmecarchaea de l'ambre de la Baltique, de l'Eocene moyen. Cependant, des caracteres uniques comme l'epaisseur et la robustesse du pedicelle et le cephalothorax tres allonge, s'affinant progressivement dans sa partie posterieure, le distinguent des autres especes du genre Myrmecarchaea. Ce specimen est particulierement interessant car, en plus d'appartenir a une espece nouvelle, il est aussi le premier male adulte connu du genre, ce qui nous permet d'observer pour la premiere fois la structure des pieces genitales. De plus, il s'agit de la premiere occurrence de ce genre hors de l'ambre de la Baltique, demontrant des affinites entre ces ambres qui sont, par ailleurs, tres differents dans la composition de leurs paleofaunes, et etend la repartition fossile connue de la famille.","[Carbuccia, Benjamin; Rollard, Christine; Nel, Andre; Garrouste, Romain] Univ Antilles, Sorbonne Univ, Inst Systemat Evolut Biodiversite ISYEB, Museum Natl Hist Nat,CNRS,EPHE, CP 50,57 Rue Cuvier, Paris, France; [Wood, Hannah M.] Smithsonian Inst, Dept Entomol, Natl Museum Nat Hist, 10th & Constitut Ave NW, Washington, DC 20560 USA","Carbuccia, B (corresponding author), Univ Antilles, Sorbonne Univ, Inst Systemat Evolut Biodiversite ISYEB, Museum Natl Hist Nat,CNRS,EPHE, CP 50,57 Rue Cuvier, Paris, France.",benjamin.carbuccia@edu.mnhn.fr,"GARROUSTE, Romain/AAK-3692-2021","GARROUSTE, Romain/0000-0002-0880-5781",,,,17,1,1,0,2,EDP SCIENCES S A,LES ULIS CEDEX A,"17, AVE DU HOGGAR, PA COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEX A, FRANCE",0037-9409,1777-5817,,BSGF-Earth Sci B,BSGF-Earth Sci.

The earliest fossils of phoroid flies are from Early Cretaceous. In this paper we describe a second species of the enigmatic phoroid fly genus Lebambromyia. The genus was erected to accommodate an extinct species, L. acrai Grimaldi and Cumming, from Lebanese amber deposit, dated at ca. 120 Mya. A new species, L. sacculifera sp. nov., is described here based on a single female specimen embedded in Myanmar mid-Cretaceous amber, which is over 20 Ma younger than the Lebanese outcrop, implying that this genus had a wide geographic and temporal distribution. The state of preservation of the new specimen and its study with phase contrast X-ray microtomography show that this ancient fly was characterized by a mix of ancient and modern features, such as specialized sensory areas in the antenna. Phylogenetic analyses support that Lebambromyia was related to flat-footed and ironic flies, but a clear phylogenetic position remains elusive. Lebambromyia sacculifera sp. nov. is described from Late Cretaceous amber from Myanmar, integrating traditional observation techniques and X-ray phase contrast microtomography. Lebambromyia sacculifera is the second species of Lebambromyia after L. acrai Grimaldi and Cumming, described from Lebanese amber (Early Cretaceous), and the first record of this taxon from Myanmar amber, considerably extending the temporal and geographic range of this genus. The new specimen bears a previously undetected set of phylogenetically relevant characters such as a postpedicel sacculus and a prominent clypeus, which are shared with Ironomyiidae and Eumuscomorpha. Our cladistic analyses confirmed that Lebambromyia represented a distinct monophyletic lineage related to Platypezidae and Ironomyiidae, though its affinities are strongly influenced by the interpretation and coding of the enigmatic set of features characterizing these fossil flies.","[Badano, Davide; Cerretti, Pierfilippo] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Biol & Biotechnol Charles Darwin, Piazzale A Moro 5, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Badano, Davide; Cerretti, Pierfilippo] Sapienza Univ Rome, Museum Zool, Piazzale Valerio Massimo 6, I-00162 Rome, Italy; [Zhang, Qingqing] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qingqing] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qingqing] Univ Bonn, Inst Geosci, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Fratini, Michela; Maugeri, Laura; Bukreeva, Inna] Sapienza Univ Rome, CNR Nanotec Rome Unit, Dept Phys, Piazzale A Moro 5, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Bukreeva, Inna] Russian Acad Sci, PN Lebedev Phys Inst, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Longo, Elena; Wilde, Fabian] Inst Mat Phys, Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Max Planck Str 1, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany; [Yeates, David K.; Cerretti, Pierfilippo] CSIRO Natl Facil & Collect, Australian Natl Insect Collect, Clunies Ross St, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia","Badano, D; Cerretti, P (corresponding author), Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Biol & Biotechnol Charles Darwin, Piazzale A Moro 5, I-00185 Rome, Italy.; Badano, D; Cerretti, P (corresponding author), Sapienza Univ Rome, Museum Zool, Piazzale Valerio Massimo 6, I-00162 Rome, Italy.; Cerretti, P (corresponding author), CSIRO Natl Facil & Collect, Australian Natl Insect Collect, Clunies Ross St, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",davide.badano@uniroma1.it; qqzhang@nigpas.ac.cn; michela.fratini@gmail.com; maugeri83@gmail.com; innabukreeva@yahoo.it; elena.longo@hzg.de; fabian.wilde@hzg.de; david.yeates@csiro.au; pierfilippo.cerretti@uniroma1.it,"Yeates, David K/A-9917-2008; Badano, Davide/J-5943-2019; Cerretti, Pierfilippo/L-6504-2016; Bukreeva, Inna/M-7946-2015","Yeates, David K/0000-0001-7729-6143; Badano, Davide/0000-0001-9715-3107; Cerretti, Pierfilippo/0000-0002-9204-3352; Bukreeva, Inna/0000-0003-1483-4965; Wilde, Fabian/0000-0002-6080-3601","SAPIExcellence BE-FOR-ERC fellowship (Sapienza University of Rome); Alexander von Humboldt Foundation from GermanyAlexander von Humboldt Foundation; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB26000000]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41688103]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)German Research Foundation (DFG) [SFB 986, 192346071]","D.B. was supported by a SAPIExcellence BE-FOR-ERC fellowship (Sapienza University of Rome).

Here we describe nearly half of a hatchling individual, based on osteological and soft tissue data obtained from the skull, neck, feet, and wing, and identified as a member of the extinct avian Glade Enantiornithes. Preserved soft tissue provides the unique opportunity to observe the external opening of the ear, the eyelid, and fine details of tarsal scutellation. The new amber specimen yields the most complete view of hatchling plumage and integument yet to be recovered from the Cretaceous, including details of pterylosis, feather microstructure, and pigmentation patterns. The hatchling was encapsulated during the earliest stages of its feather production, providing a point for comparisons to other forms of body fossils, as well as isolated feathers found in Cretaceous ambers. The plumage preserves an unusual combination of precocial and altricial features unlike any living hatchling bird, having functional remiges combined with sparse body feathers. Unusual feather morphotypes on the legs, feet, and tail suggest that first generation feathers in the Enantiornithes may have been much more like contour feathers than the natal down observed in many modern birds. However, these regions also preserve filamentous feathers that appear comparable to the protofeathers observed in more primitive theropods. Overall, the new specimen brings a new level of detail to our understanding of the anatomy of the juvenile stages of the most species-rich Glade of pre-modern birds and contributes to mounting data that enantiornithine development drastically differed from that of Neornithes.

So far, five bird specimens have been described from Burmese amber: two isolated wings, an isolated foot with wing fragment, and two partial skeletons [4, 8-10]. Most of these specimens contain the remains of juvenile enantiornithine birds [4]. Here, we describe a new specimen of enantiornithine bird in amber, collected at the Angbamo locality in the Hukawng Valley. The new specimen includes a partial right hindlimb and remiges from an adult or subadult bird. Its foot, of which the third digit is much longer than the second and fourth digits, is distinct from those of all other currently recognized Mesozoic and extant birds. Based on the autapomorphic foot morphology, we erect a new taxon, Elektorornis chenguangi gen. et sp. nov. We suggest that the elongated third digit was employed in a unique foraging strategy, highlighting the bizarre morphospace in which early birds operated.","[Xing, Lida] China Univ Geosci, State Key Lab Biogeol & Environm Geol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Xing, Lida] China Univ Geosci, Sch Earth Sci & Resources, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [O'Connor, Jingmai K.] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Paleontol & Paleoanthropol, Key Lab Vertebrate Evolut & Human Origins, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [O'Connor, Jingmai K.] CAS Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, Beijing 10010, Peoples R China; [Chiappe, Luis M.; Carroll, Nathan] Nat Hist Museum Los Angeles Cty, Dinosaur Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA; [McKellar, Ryan C.] Royal Saskatchewan Museum, Regina, SK S4P 4W7, Canada; [McKellar, Ryan C.] Univ Regina, Biol Dept, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada; [McKellar, Ryan C.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Hu, Han] Univ New England, Sch Environm & Rural Sci, Zool Div, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia; [Bai, Ming; Lei, Fuming] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Xing, LD (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, State Key Lab Biogeol & Environm Geol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.; Xing, LD (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, Sch Earth Sci & Resources, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.; O'Connor, JK (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Paleontol & Paleoanthropol, Key Lab Vertebrate Evolut & Human Origins, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China.; O'Connor, JK (corresponding author), CAS Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, Beijing 10010, Peoples R China.",xinglida@gmail.com; jingmai@ivpp.ac.cn,,"Hu, Han/0000-0001-5926-7306","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41888101, 41790455, 41772008]; National Geographic Society, USNational Geographic Society [EC0768-15]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central UniversitiesFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [2652017215]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR [2015-00681]","We thank Chunyong Chou and Qiuxia Lin from China University of Geosciences, Beijing, for measuring extant birds and R.

Recent explorations of Mesozoic scydmaenine fauna in Burmese, Canadian, French, and Spanish ambers have shed intriguing light on the early evolution, systematics, and particular aspects of predator-prey relationship among this group. However, in contrast to extant diversity, well-preserved fossils allowing for sufficient morphological studies and ecological reconstructions are extremely rare. Here we report a highly advanced glandulariine scydmaenine, Nuegua elongata Yin, Cai & Newton, gen. et sp. nov., based on a large series of fifteen exquisitely preserved specimens entombed in mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber. The new genus strikingly displays an extremely prolonged preocular region that accounts for over half of the head length-a structure unknown among all known living and extinct scydmaenines, but analogous to that of certain groups of the modern Laemophloeidae, Curculionoidea, Salpingidae, and Staphylinidae. We provide a formal description of the new genus, compare it with the most probably related taxa, and discuss possible functions of this bizarre head elongation.

A phylogenetic analysis of all Phoroidea families, including all ironomyiid extant and extinct genera, corroborates the monophyly of Ironomyiidae, and Macalpinomyia gen.n. is assigned to the subfamily Sinolestinae. Cretonomyiinae subfam.n., is erected to accommodate the basal lineage of Ironomyiidae. Lebambromyia acrai Grimaldi & Cumming, previously placed in Ironomyiidae, is supported as an early branching lineage of Platypezidae.

The family Tarachocelidae previously described from Burmese amber and then placed in Amphiesmenoptera incertae sedis is assigned to this new order. The genus Kinitocelis gen. nov. is established to accommodate three new fossil species: K. hennigi spec. nov., K. divisinotata spec. nov. and K. brevicostata spec. nov. The new genus differs from Tarachocelis gen. nov. by the absence of androconial scales on the wings and the loss of Cu2 in the forewings. The species are described in detail and the critical characters are illustrated by line drawings and photos. Both males and females were described. The species can be distinguished by traits in the wing venation. The new order Tarachoptera is placed in the super-order Amphiesmenoptera based on the presence of seven amphiesmenopteran apomorphies and nine tarachopteran apomorphies. Apomorphic characters of Trichoptera and Lepidoptera could not be disclosed, which suggests an independent origin and evolution from an amphiesmenopteran ancestor which was not the ancestor of the Trichoptera-Lepidoptera clade. The species of Tarachoptera are tiny insects with a wing span of 2.3-4.5mm but highly specialized according to their aberrant morphology. Aspects of the presumed life history of the adults were deduced from some of the derived morphological traits that could be interpreted as adaptations to a highly structured micro-environment.","[Mey, Wolfram] Humboldt Univ, Leibniz Inst Evolut & Biodivers Res, Museum Nat Kunde, Invalidenstr 43, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Wichard, Wilfried] Univ Cologne, Inst Biol, Gronewaldstr 2, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; [Mueller, Patrick] Friedhofstr 9, D-66894 Kashofen, Germany; [Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Mey, W (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Leibniz Inst Evolut & Biodivers Res, Museum Nat Kunde, Invalidenstr 43, D-10115 Berlin, Germany.; Wichard, W (corresponding author), Univ Cologne, Inst Biol, Gronewaldstr 2, D-50931 Cologne, Germany.; Muller, P (corresponding author), Friedhofstr 9, D-66894 Kashofen, Germany.; Wang, B (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Wang, B (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",wolfram.mey@mfn-berlin.de; wichard@uni-koeln.de; pat14789@web.de; bowang@nigpas.ac.cn,,,"Museum for Naturkunde, Berlin; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41572010, 41622201]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of CAS [2011224]; Alexander von Humboldt FoundationAlexander von Humboldt Foundation","Our sincere thanks go to Jason Dunlop (MfN, Berlin) for the correction of the English text of the first draft of the manuscript.

A triungulin from the Late Cretaceous (Campanian, c. 80 myo) of Manitoba, Canada is possibly a strepsipteran. The triungulin is described in detail but its morphology does not conform to any known clade of Recent strepsipterans. Other Cretaceous triungula reported here are in Burmese amber and are probably of the family Rhipiphoridae (Coleoptera), and bizarre (possibly coleopteran) triungula in mid-Cretaceous (Turonian, c. 90 myo) amber from New Jersey, USA. Phylogenetic analysis confirms the primitive position of Cretostylops among families of Strepsiptera, but it is not as primitive as Protoxenos in Eocene Baltic amber. Protoxenos and Cretostylops are still too highly modified to address the controversial relationships of Strepsiptera among insect orders, but the generalized structure of the mandible is inconsistent with the hypothesis that this order is the sister group to Diptera or closely related to Mecopterida. Phylogeny of living and Recent Strepsiptera suggests an origin of the order in the Early Cretaceous or Late Jurassic, which is also inconsistent with this order being a sister group to the much older Diptera.","Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, New York, NY 10024 USA; Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; CUNY, Baruch Coll, Dept Nat Sci, New York, NY USA","Grimaldi, D (corresponding author), Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, Cent Pk W 79th St, New York, NY 10024 USA.",grimaldi@amnh.org; jeyaraney.kathirithamby@zoology.oxford.ac.uk; valerie_schawaroch@baruch.cuny.edu,,,,,,58,51,54,0,6,BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",1399-560X,1876-312X,,INSECT SYST EVOL,Insect Syst.

This work deals with 109 specimens from the mid Cretaceous (Cenomanian or possibly slightly lower) of Myanmar, 37 of which have been identified to the generic level; 14 new species are described. Two species of the family Isotomidae are placed in previously described genera. One is placed in the Late Cretaceous genus Protoismoma (burma), and one in the extant genus Proisotoma (s.l.) pettersoni. The remaining specimens are placed in 11 newly erected genera or as Incertae sedis taxa in the broadly construed families Sminthuridae, Isotomidae, and Neanuridae. The new genera are Sminthuridae (s.l.): Grinnellia, Sminthuricinus, Mucrovirga, and Sminthurconus; Isotomidae: Villusisotoma (two species, V. brevis and V. longa), Burmisotoma, Propachyotoma, and Protodesoria; Neanuridae (s.l.) Protodontella. Two new genera (Praentomobrya and Cretacentomobrya) are placed in a new family (Praentombryidae), which is similar to the modem family Entomobryidae. Most of the extinct genera are very similar to modern genera. This similarity, along with the occurrence of an extant genus, suggests that a greater proportion of the Collembola of Myanmar (Burma) survived the end-Cretaceous than did taxa in Canada, even though the former are approximately 30 Ma older.

Pselaphinae is split basally into two principal clades: the small supertribe Faronitae, and its sister group, the hyper-diverse higher Pselaphinae' containing the remaining five supertribes. Deducing the origins and divergence times of major higher Pselaphinae clades requires direct fossil evidence. Here we describe a new pselaphine rove beetle, Cretobythus excavatus Yin, Parker & Cai gen. et sp. nov., based on a well-preserved individual embedded in mid-Cretaceous amber from Myanmar (Cenomanian, c. 99 Ma). Cretobythus does not obviously belong to any Recent tribe, but Bayesian phylogenetic placement using morphological characters supports a position within the stem-group of the tribe Bythinini, sister to Boreotethys Parker, a genus also recently described from Burmese amber. Together, Cretobythus + Boreotethys comprise the sister group of modern Bythinini. Despite some external similarities to Recent Bythinini, Cretobythus exhibits several plesiomorphic traits, including a generally flattened body plan, and metacoxae that are positioned close to the ventral midline. The resemblance in form of the enlarged maxillary palpi of Cretobythus to extant bythinines implies a similar function in prey capture, indicating that the unusual employment of the maxillary palps to trap moving prey in Bythinini had probably evolved by the mid-Cretaceous, at the latest.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:9FEB523F-76A7-4502-AF02-FCC0FAAB262A","[Yin, Zi-Wei; Li, Li-Zhen] Shanghai Normal Univ, Dept Biol, 100 Guilin Rd, Shanghai 200234, Peoples R China; [Parker, Joseph] Columbia Univ, Dept Genet & Dev, New York, NY USA; [Parker, Joseph] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Cai, Chen-Yang] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, Key Lab Econ Stratig & Palaeogeog, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Huang, Di-Ying] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Cai, CY (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, Key Lab Econ Stratig & Palaeogeog, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",cycai@nigpas.ac.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31501874, 41602009, 91514302]; Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai MunicipalityScience & Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (STCSM) [15YF1408700]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB18030501]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu ProvinceNatural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20161091]","Alfred F.

Here, we describe a new specimen that consists of the distal extremities of both forelimbs and hindlimbs. Size and morphology suggest the specimen represents an immature individual. Although the skeletal morphology is poorly preserved, the new specimen most probably represents a member of the Enantiornithes based on the sum of its preserved morphologies, including its small size, elongate penultimate pedal phalanges, and large recurved unguals. Based on the lengths of the metatarsals, the new specimen is even smaller than previously described enantiornithines that preserve these elements; however, the forelimb elements are longer than those in the only other specimen preserving comparable overlapping skeletal material. This is suggestive of a diversity of limb proportions in the Burmese enantiornithine fauna, similar to that observed in the Jehol avifauna, in which intermembral indices range from approximately 1 to 1.5. The wing appears to consist of eight primaries, less than that of neornithines, contributing to mounting data that suggests the flight apparatus of enantiornithines was unique from that of other basal birds and neornithines. The well-preserved flight feathers are ornamented with pale basal bands, further adding to the diversity of Cretaceous plumage patterns revealed by Burmese amber specimens.","[Xing, Lida] China Univ Geosci, State Key Lab Biogeol & Environm Geol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xing, Lida] China Univ Geosci, Sch Earth Sci & Resources, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xing, Lida; Niu, Kecheng] Yingliang Stone Nat Hist Museum, Nanan, Peoples R China; [O'Connor, Jingmai K.] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Paleontol & Paleoanthropol, Key Lab Vertebrate Evolut & Human Origins, Beijing, Peoples R China; [O'Connor, Jingmai K.] CAS Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Cockx, Pierre; McKellar, Ryan C.] Royal Saskatchewan Museum, Regina, SK, Canada; [Cockx, Pierre; McKellar, Ryan C.] Univ Regina, Dept Biol, Regina, SK, Canada; [Mai, Huijuan] Yunnan Univ, Yunnan Key Lab Palaeobiol, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Mai, Huijuan] Yunnan Univ, MEC Int Lab Palaeobiol & Palaeoenvironm, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [McKellar, Ryan C.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA","O'Connor, JK (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Paleontol & Paleoanthropol, Key Lab Vertebrate Evolut & Human Origins, Beijing, Peoples R China.; O'Connor, JK (corresponding author), CAS Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, Beijing, Peoples R China.",jingmai@ivpp.ac.cn,,,"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR [2015-00681]; National Geographic Society, United StatesNational Geographic Society [EC0768-15]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41790455, 41772008]; The Foreign Cultural and Educational Experts Employment Program from Foreign Experts Service Division, Ministry of Science and Technology of China [G20190001245]","This research was funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (2015-00681); the National Geographic Society, United States (EC0768-15); and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 41790455 and 41772008).

This successful group is today very common and.abundant in forests of all continents. However, while extinct representatives of much smaller extant tribes, as Clidicini, Eutheiini and Cephenniini, were described from Cretaceous deposits, named genera and species of Glandulariini were so far known only from much younger Baltic, Sicilian and Dominican ambers. Here we report the first genus and species of definite Glandulariini from the Upper Cretaceous Burmese amber, Scydmobisetia vetutissima Jaioszyfiski and Yamamoto, gen. and sp. nov. Scydmobisetia is the first known glandulariine beetle with a pair of very long vertexal sensilla chaetica, previously not found in this tribe, but common among unrelated Staphylinidae. The new genus shows similarities to the extant genera Anthicimimus, Sciacharis, Spinosciacharis and Horaeomorphus, but S. vetutissima has protibial modifications typical of males of some extant species of Euconnus. We discuss the apparent disproportion in the oldest fossil record of various tribes of scydmaenines as a result of identification problems, and not the lack of known fossils. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Important details of skeletal ontogeny, including the stage at which snake zygosphene-zygantral joints began to form along with the neural arch lamina, are preserved. The vertebrae show similarities to those of fossil Gondwanan snakes, suggesting a dispersal route of Gondwanan faunas to Laurasia.

The group Raphidioptera is rather species-poor, with only slightly more than 200 species. Snake-fly larvae are rather uniform in appearance and possess an elongate body; the trunk has similar appearing segments and lacks specialisations such as protruding structures. Such larvae are also known from the fossil record, namely from fossils preserved in amber that largely resemble extant forms. Here we report a new fossil snake-fly larva from Burmese amber. The specimen is very unusual in the morphology of the antennae. In extant snake-fly larvae, the antenna is quite short and thin, often inconspicuous at first sight on normal habitus photographs. In the new fossil, the antenna is much longer than the head and also appears very robust, comparable to the thoracic appendages. Together with another snake-fly larva previously described from Burmese amber, this find demonstrates that there were larval morphologies of snakefly larvae hack in the Cretaceous that are absent in the modern fauna.","[Haug, Joachim T.; Haug, Carolin] Ludwig Maximilian Univ Munich, Bioctr, Grosshaderner Str 2, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany; [Mueller, Patrick] GeoBioctr LMU, Richard Wagner Str 10, D-80333 Munich, Germany","Haug, JT (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilian Univ Munich, Bioctr, Grosshaderner Str 2, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany.",joachim.haug@palaeo-evo-devo.info,,,Volkswagen FoundationVolkswagen,"The Volkswagen Foundation kindly funds JTH with a Lichtenberg Professorship.

A new genus and species, Cantabroberotha soplaensis gen. et sp. nov., are erected based on a complete amber specimen from the El Soplao outcrop (Cantabria, northern Spain). Four indeterminate berothids based on incomplete specimens are described from Periacerrada I amber (Burgos, northern Spain). One of these provides a rare instance of an amber fossil being partially preserved as an impression rather than as a complete inclusion. This was the result of the lacewing not fully penetrating into a resin flow, its wings getting caught on the resin surface and leaving an imprint. The preservation of this delicate impression fossil allows us to infer that a low grade transport likely occurred, at least partly, during the biostratinomic phase of the genesis of the Pertacerrada I amber deposit, similar to what was inferred for the El Soplao amber deposit. Moreover, one of the incomplete berothid inclusions has an indeterminate, likely immature mesostigmatan mite attached to the proximal part of its hind wing, most parsimoniously resulting from a symbiotic interaction, probably phoresy.

We present a rare glimpse of live birth by a terrestrial mother snail, incidentally, engulfed by amber as she released her young in a tropical forest during the mid-Cretaceous (early Cenomanian). The exceptional finding featuring the preservation of a snail & rsquo;s 99-million-year-old soft-body together with five neonate shells represents the earliest known fossilized incidence of viviparity in a terrestrial snail. Based on high-resolution photographs and mCT scans, we describe the mother snail as a new species of cyclophoroid, Cretatortulosa gignens sp. nov. Our finding provides remarkable perspectives for interpreting gastropod evolution 80 million years ear-lier than the fossil record has known up to now. It shows that viviparity was already a relevant reproduc-tive strategy in the Cretaceous, probably increasing the offspring & rsquo;s survival chance in a predator-lurking tropical forest.

Amber fossils have contributed to the understanding of the phylogeny, biology, and biogeography of insects and other groups, and have also gained great importance for dating molecular trees. Another major potential is the documentation of faunal, floral and climatic shifts. Evolutionary transitions can be well-documented in amber fossils and can reveal anatomical transformations and the age of appearance of structural features. Here, using a new stem group species of Strepsiptera from Burmite, we evaluate this potential of amber insect fossils to assess the current phylogeny of Strepsiptera, with the main emphasis on the early splitting events in the stem group. Amber fossils have greatly contributed to the understanding of the evolution of Strepsiptera in the late Mesozoic and the Cenozoic. dagger Heterobathmilla kakopoiosPohl and Beutelgen. et sp. n.described here is placed in the stem group of the order, in a clade with dagger Kinzelbachilla(dagger Kinzelbachillidae) and dagger Phthanoxenos(dagger Phthanoxenidae). dagger Phthanoxenidae has priority over dagger Kinzelbachillidae, and the latter is synonymised. The superb details available from this new fossil allowed us to explore unique features of the antennae, mouthparts, and male copulatory apparatus, and to provide a phylogenetic hypothesis for the order. The younger dagger Protoxenosfrom Eocene Baltic amber was confirmed as sister to all remaining extinct and extant groups of Strepsiptera, whereas the position of the Cretaceous dagger Cretostylopsin the stem group remains ambivalent. While the value of Burmite and amber from other periods has a recognized impact on our knowledge of the evolution in various lineages, this new fossil does not fundamentally change our picture of the phylogeny and evolution of early Strepsiptera. However, it offers new insights into the morphological diversity in the early evolution of the group.","[Pohl, Hans; Beutel, Rolf Georg] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Zool & Evolutionsforsch, Entomol Grp, Erbertstr 1, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Wipfler, Benjamin] Zool Forschungsmuseum Alexander Koenig, Bonn, Germany; [Boudinot, Brendon] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol Nematol, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Pohl, H; Beutel, RG (corresponding author), Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Zool & Evolutionsforsch, Entomol Grp, Erbertstr 1, D-07743 Jena, Germany.",hans.pohl@uni-jena.de; rolf.beutel@uni-jena.de,"Pohl, Hans/M-6873-2019",,Zoologisches Forschungsmuseum Alexander Koenig (Bonn),"We thank Birgit Perner (Leibniz-Institut fur Alternsforschung - Fritz-Lippmann-Institut, Jena) for providing us access to the Axio Zoom.V16.

COLEOPTERA; BALTIC AMBER; 1ST FOSSIL; STAPHYLINIDAE; EVOLUTION; DIVERSIFICATION; BEHAVIOR; CLASSIFICATION,"Stenus is the largest genus of rove beetles and the second largest among animals. Its evolutionary success was associated with the adhesive labial prey-capture apparatus, a unique apomorphy of that genus. Definite Stenus with prey-capture apparatus are known from the Cenozoic fossils, while the age and early evolution of Steninae was hardly ever hypothesized. Our study of several Cretaceous Burmese amber inclusions revealed a stem lineage of Steninae that possibly possesses the Stenus-like prey-capture apparatus. Phylogenetic analysis of extinct and extant taxa of Steninae and putatively allied subfamilies of Staphylinidae with parsimony and Bayesian approaches resolved the Burmese amber lineage as a member of Steninae. It justified the description of a new extinct stenine genus Festenus with two new species, F. robustus and F. gracilis. The Late Cretaceous age of Festenus suggests an early origin of prey-capture apparatus in Steninae that, perhaps, drove the evolution towards the crown Stenus. Our analysis confirmed the well-established sister relationships between Steninae and Euaesthetinae and resolved Scydmaeninae as their next closest relative, the latter having no stable position in recent phylogenetic studies of rove beetles. Close affiliation of Megalopsidiinae, a subfamily often considered as a sister group to Euaesthetinae + Steninae clade, is rejected.","[Zyla, Dagmara; Solodovnikov, Alexey] Nat Hist Museum Denmark, Zool Museum, Biosyst Sect, Univ Pk 15, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Yamamoto, Shuhei] Kyushu Univ, Entomol Lab, Grad Sch Bioresource & Bioenvironm Sci, Hakozaki 6-10-1, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan; [Wolf-Schwenninger, Karin] Staatliches Museum Naturkunde Stuttgart, Praparat Bernstein & Entomol, Rosenstein 1, D-70191 Stuttgart, Germany","Zyla, D; Solodovnikov, A (corresponding author), Nat Hist Museum Denmark, Zool Museum, Biosyst Sect, Univ Pk 15, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.",zyladagmara@gmail.com; asolodovnikov@snm.ku.dk,"Yamamoto, Shuhei/U-8247-2018; Solodovnikov, Alexey/A-2298-2012","Yamamoto, Shuhei/0000-0002-4162-8457; Solodovnikov, Alexey/0000-0003-2031-849X; Zyla, Dagmara/0000-0003-4959-763X","Villum Foundation; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, TokyoMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [14J02669]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [14J02669] Funding Source: KAKEN","We are grateful to D.

Evolutionary and palaeoecological interpretations using fossil beetles from Cretaceous ambers have become increasingly frequent in recent years, consequently leading to the discovery of an increasing number of new coleopteran species. By the end of 2019, a total of 364 new species from 81 families (some of them only known as fossils) were compiled, which are presented in this article. Beetles are currently among the most important pollinators of basal flowering plants and are thought to have been so since the origin of angiosperms. Some recent studies on specimens from Cretaceous amber support this idea, indicating the existence of a pre-existing guild of beetles that pollinated gymnosperms during the Early Cretaceous, with some groups moving from older gymnosperm to more recent angiosperm hosts. The effect of wood-boring beetle pests on resiniferous ancient forests has been widely cited in the literature, but there is no direct evidence in Cretaceous ambers. The current abundance of Lymexylidae beetles in Kachin amber (Myanmar) suggests that together with abiotic factors such as wildfires, storms, hurricanes and volcanos, fungal infections should also be thoroughly analysed as a cause of resin release in the past. In this review, we show how beetles from Cretaceous ambers are a useful tool for studying community and trophic structures as well as evolutionary implications for the ecosystem.

Co- pal resins of lesser age and lower maturity are similar in appearance to ambers but semi-fossilized. Both copal resins and ambers are the products of fossilized processes of natural resins, and the chemical compositions of them bear typical characteristics of transitivity, over tapping and similarity, which makes the identification difficult. Recently copal resins from two origins are found in Chinese market. Borneo copal resins with brownish-red or brown appearance are easily mistaken for Burmese ambers, while Madagascar Copal Resins with faint yellow or golden color are confused with Baltic ambers. The market prices of copal resins and ambers with similar appearances vary considerably, which has aroused wide attention. Research objects were Borneo copal resins and Burmese ambers, Madagascar copal resins and Baltic ambers. Each category were selected 4 representative samples, a total of 16 pieces. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopies were performed at the School of Gemology, China University of Geosciences in Beijing (CUGB). Using KBr pellet transmission method (100 mg KBr and 1. 0 mg sample), mid-infrared (4 000 similar to 400 cm(-1)) spectra of investigated copal resins and ambers were obtained by a BRUKER TENSOR 27 FTIR spectrophotometer, with a resolution of 4 cm(-1) and 16 scans each sample, at room temperature. Investigated Copal resins and ambers had distinct differences of shift and intensity of absorption peaks in the spectra, which might be used to rapidly identify them. The spectroscopic characteristics of Borneo copal resins were four absorption peaks in the region 3 000 similar to 2 800 cm(-1), one strong absorption peak at 1 710 cm(-1) and one shoulder peak at 1 730 cm(-1), two weak peaks at 887 and 824 cm(-1). The spectroscopic characteristics of Madagascar copal resins were three typical absorption peaks relevant to C=C functional group, one strong absorption peak at 1 697 cm(-1) and one shoulder peak at 1 724 cm(-1) W-shaped figure composed by two absorption peaks at 1 271 and 1 176 cm(-1). Burmese ambers similar with Borneo copal resins can be rapidly identified by the absorption peaks in the region 3 000 similar to 2 800 cm(-1), one strong absorption peak at 1 724 cm(-1), W-shaped figurein the region 1 300 similar to 1 100 cm(-1). Baltic ambers confused with Madagascar copal resins can be rapidly distinguished by the typical figure of Baltic shoulder. In addition, R (A(1) (383) cm(-1) /A(1 464) cm(-1)) value of Borneo copal resins are 0. 823 similar to 0. 860, greater than 0. 605 similar to 0. 643 of Burmese ambers. 0. 900 similar to 0. 985 of Madagascar copal resins were greater than 0. 704 similar to 0. 783 of Baltic ambers. R value can also be one of identification features. Domestic researches about ambers and copal resins were focused on GC-MS Class I type whose macromolecular structure were based on polymers or copolymers of labdanoid diterpenes. Previous research objects of copal resins were mainly from New Zealand and Colombia, lacking of Borneo and Madagascar copal resins. This research comparatively analyzed copal resins and ambers with similar appearances (Borneo copal resins and Burmese ambers, Madagascar copal resins and Baltic ambers), It revealed the infrared spectroscopic characteristics of Borneo copal resins and Madagascar copal resins and provided the scientific evidence to rapidly identify copal resins and ambers with similar appearances. Combined with previous studies, these research findings showed that infrared spectroscopy may have scientific significance for the classification of copal resins from different origins, as well as for the identification between confused copal reins and ambers.","[Dai Li-li; Shi Guang-hai; Yuan Ye; Wang Mei-li; Wang Yan] China Univ Geosci, State Key Lab Geol Proc & Mineral Resources, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China","Shi, GH (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, State Key Lab Geol Proc & Mineral Resources, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",545083570@qq.com; shigh@cugb.edu.cn,"Shi, Guanghai/AAJ-7206-2020","Shi, Guanghai/0000-0003-0089-3745",,,,18,3,3,1,13,OFFICE SPECTROSCOPY & SPECTRAL ANALYSIS,BEIJING,"NO 76 COLLAGE SOUTH RD BEIJING, BEIJING 100081, PEOPLES R CHINA",1000-0593,,,SPECTROSC SPECT ANAL,Spectrosc.

The extinct aphid family Szelegiewicziidae is supposed to be one of the oviparous lineages in aphid evolution. New material from the rock fossil deposits of Shar Teg (Upper Jurassic of Mongolia), Baissa (Lower Cretaceous of Siberia-Russia), and Burmese amber (Upper Cretaceous of Myanmar) allowed us to undertake a more detailed examination of the morphological features and carry out an analysis of the taxonomical composition and evolution of the family. This led us to the conclusion that evolution of the body plan and wing structure was similar in different, often not closely related groups, probably as a result of convergence.

These larvae are well known from Myanmar amber (about 100 mya) and Baltic amber (mostly 34-38 mya, possibly 23-48 mya), as well as from the extant fauna. We report and figure numerous additional specimens from both amber types and from ca. 100 mya old French Charentese amber, expanding the known record of well-illustrated extant and fossil specimens from 26 to 52 specimens. We compare the diversity of head shape among these larvae through time by outline analysis. Results indicate that morphological diversity was pronouncedly higher in the Cretaceous, even after sample size correction. Eocene representatives are more diverse than modern representatives, but less diverse than Cretaceous ones, in one shape aspect that explains most of the overall variation (55.7%). Eocene representatives are less diverse in another shape aspect that explains the second-most variation (26.9%), but this might reflect a lack of first larval stage specimens. There seems to be no strong correlation between size and shape. This type of analysis enables a test for the loss of diversity over time, based on morphological diversity as a proxy, without the requirement of identifying fossil larvae down to a narrow taxonomical range.","[Haug, Gideon T.; Haug, Carolin; Pazinato, Paula G.; Braig, Florian; Haug, Joachim T.] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Bioctr, Grosshaderner Str 2, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany; [Haug, Carolin; Haug, Joachim T.] LMU, GeoBio Ctr, Richard Wagner Str 10, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Perrichot, Vincent] Univ Rennes, Geosci Rennes, CNRS, UMR 6118, F-35000 Rennes, France; [Groehn, Carsten] Bunebuttler Weg 7, D-21509 Glinde, Germany; [Mueller, Patrick] Friedhofstr 9, D-66894 Kashofen, Germany","Haug, GT (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Bioctr, Grosshaderner Str 2, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany.",gideon.haug@palaeo-evo-devo.info; carolin.haug@palaeo-evo-devo.info; paula.pazinato@palaeo-evo-devo.info; florianbraig@t-online.de; florianbraig@t-online.de; vincent.perrichot@univ-rennes1.fr; pat14789@web.de; joachim.haug@palaeo-evo-devo.info,,"Perrichot, Vincent/0000-0002-7973-0430; Braig, Florian/0000-0003-0640-6012","Volkswagen FoundationVolkswagen; Lichtenberg Professorship; Capes/Doctoral Program (CAPES/DAAD/CNPQ) [15-2017, 88887.161379/2017-00]; LMUexcellent Junior Researcher Fund; LMU Munich; CNRS project ECLIPSE `Interactions climat/ecosystemes de l'Aptien au Paleocene'","This study heavily benefited from the help of various people and institutions; we thank them for their support.

Specimens of Kachinus magnificus (originally placed as incertae sedis within Scydmaenitae) were re-examined and their characters were found different from those of the type species of Kachinus from Myanmar amber. Consequently, Archeutheia gen. nov. is proposed to accommodate the Spanish species, resulting in Archeutheia magmfica comb. nov. Moreover, in a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis Archeutheia was placed as a sister group to extant Eutheia, within the tribe Eutheiini of Cephenniitae. A specimen of an undetermined genus from Myanmar amber clearly belonging in Cephenniini is also recorded. Both taxa represent the first definite Cretaceous Cephenniitae, a supertribe whose recent members are distributed on all continents but are especially diverse in the Oriental and East Palaearctic regions. This finding demonstrates a diversification Of two presently most species-rich tribes of Cephenniitae already in Early Cretaceous. Archeutheia is strikingly similar to the extant species of Eutheia and Veraphis, showing male dimorphic characters (modified protrochanters) and antennal cavities characteristic of Palaearctic Eutheiini. This fact suggests a long morphological stability in the supertribe. A previously proposed hypothesis of an early presence of the Cephenniitae in the Northern Hemisphere is for the first time supported by the fossil record, and the palaeolocalities (western Europe and Southeast Asia) demonstrate a wide distribution of Cephenniitae in the Cretaceous and an early split of its ancestral lineage.

Detailed morphological study of a new well-preserved Cretaceous Burmese amber fossil revealed strong evidence consistent with its taxonomic placement in the euaesthetine genus Octavius. We thus describe Octavius electrospinosus sp. nov., the first Cretaceous record of the genus and of the tribe Euaesthetini. Previously, the oldest records of Octavius and Euaesthetini were from the Eocene (Baltic amber) and discovery of O. electrospinosus sp. nov. therefore nearly doubles the minimum lineage age of Octavius, increasing it by similar to 50 million years. We also briefly review the known Euaesthetine subgroup fossil record and tabulate summary data for all previously described fossils. All are placed in extant genera, and have visible diagnostic generic-level characters including some putative synapomorphies as judged by recent phylogenetic work. Including O. electrospinosus sp. nov., there are now four known Cretaceous species, all of which belong to either Octavius, Nordenskioldia, or Stenus. To explain the long-term morphological stasis in this group of rove beetles, we suggest that the continuous presence of mesic habitats may have buffered these lineages from strong selection for morphological change. Considering the fossils along with phylogenetic hypotheses we suggest the Euaesthetine subgroup originated in the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous and the Staphylinine group in the Early Jurassic. We emphasize the derived status of Cretaceous fossils in assessing possible divergence times and the significance of the pre-Cretaceous taphonomic bias for restricting more robust estimates. Further detailed morphological study of available fossils in a phylogenetic framework is badly needed to clarify the phylogenetic positions of these taxa. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We present exceptional direct evidence preserved in mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber, 100 mya, for feeding on pollen in the eudicot genus Tricolporoidites by a basal new aculeate wasp, Prosphex anthophilos, gen. et sp. nov., in the lineage that contains the ants, bees, and other stinging wasps. Plume of hundreds of pollen grains wafts from its mouth and an apparent pollen mass was detected by micro-CT in the buccal cavity: clear evidence that the wasp was foraging on the pollen. Eudicots today comprise nearly three-quarters of all angiosperm species. Prosphex feeding on Tricolporoidites supports the hypothesis that relatively small, generalized insect anthophiles were important pollinators of early angiosperms.","[Grimaldi, David A.; Herhold, Hollister W.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Cent Pk West 79th St, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Penalver, Enrique; Barron, Eduardo] Museo Geominero, Inst Geol & Minero Espana, Rios Rosas 23, E-28003 Madrid, Spain; [Engel, Michael S.] Univ Kansas, Div Entomol, Nat Hist Museum, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Engel, Michael S.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA","Grimaldi, DA (corresponding author), Amer Museum Nat Hist, Cent Pk West 79th St, New York, NY 10024 USA.",grimaldi@amnh.org,"Engel, Michael S/C-5461-2012","Engel, Michael S/0000-0003-3067-077X; Herhold, Hollister/0000-0002-6377-4711; Barron, Eduardo/0000-0003-4979-1117","U.S. NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [EAR 0959384]; Spanish AEI/FEDER, UE [CGL2017-84419]","AMNH CT instrumentation was made possible through U.S. NSF grant EAR 0959384.

Representatives of Peripatidae, a major subgroup of velvet worms (Onychophora), show a disjointed distribution in the neotropics, tropical Africa, and Southeast Asia, the latter being the only landmass previously associated with Laurasia [1, 2]. The arrival of these animals in Southeast Asia is explained by two alternative, albeit not mutually exclusive, hypotheses: an early migration via Europe before continental drift (Eurogondwana hypothesis) or transportation via insular India during the Cretaceous and Paleogene (out-of-India hypothesis) [3-6]. The latter hypothesis is based on a single extant species of Peripatidae, Typhloperipatus williamsoni, in India. dagger Cretoperipatus burmiticus from Myanmar is the oldest fossil onychophoran found in amber [7], dating to sometime between the two proposed scenarios, and hence crucial for clarifying how Gondwanan lineages of these low-vagility animals reached Southeast Asia (see also Supplemental Information). Based on the anatomical reconstruction of dagger C. burmiticus using synchrotron radiation-based X-ray microtomography (SR mu CT) and comparisons with extant taxa, we resolved this fossil species within Onychophora, particularly within Peripatidae, with T. williamsoni as its closest extant relative. This suggests that an early Eurogondwanan migration of peripatids was the most likely event, as Burmese amber is too old to be compatible with the out-of-India hypothesis. Moreover, peripatids probably colonized India only recently from Myanmar, refuting the putative Gondwanan relict status of Indian onychophorans. Finally, preservation artifacts identified in the novel amber material might have a major impact on studies of onychophoran stem and/or crown groups.","[Oliveira, Ivo de Sena; Bai, Ming; Zhang, Weiwei] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, Box 92,Beichen West Rd 1, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Oliveira, Ivo de Sena; Jahn, Henry; Gross, Vladimir; Martin, Christine; Mayer, Georg] Univ Kassel, Inst Biol, Dept Zool, Heinrich Plett Str 40, D-34132 Kassel, Germany; [Hammel, Joerg U.] Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Inst Mat Res, Max Planck Str 1, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany","Oliveira, ID; Bai, M (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, Box 92,Beichen West Rd 1, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.; Oliveira, ID (corresponding author), Univ Kassel, Inst Biol, Dept Zool, Heinrich Plett Str 40, D-34132 Kassel, Germany.",ivo.oliveira@uni-kassel.de; baim@ioz.ac.cn,"Oliveira, Ivo S./H-3727-2013; Hammel, Jorg/D-6555-2011; Mayer, Georg/Y-9581-2018","Oliveira, Ivo S./0000-0002-8340-7660; Hammel, Jorg/0000-0002-6744-6811; Mayer, Georg/0000-0003-0737-2440; Jahn, Henry/0000-0001-6270-4685; Gross, Vladimir/0000-0001-7422-9148; Martin, Christine/0000-0003-0895-4936","National Science Fund of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [NSFC-J1210002, 31672345]; Research Equipment Development Project of Chinese Academy of Sciences [YZ201509]; Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq Brazil)Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPQ) [290029/2010-4]; Helmholtz Research Centre [DESY: I-20150213]; German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) scholarshipDeutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD); Emmy Noether Programme of the German Research Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [Ma 4147/3-1]; Alexander von Humboldt FoundationAlexander von Humboldt Foundation","We are thankful to Dr. Hilke Ruhberg, Dr. Joachim T.

An examination of fossil flowers in mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber and mid-Tertiary Dominican amber revealed a range of secretory tissues in the form of nectaries, glandular trichomes, eliaphores and osmophores. These tissues most certainly secreted liquids and volatiles to attract pollinators, just as they do in modern flowers. The morphological similarities of secretory tissues found on fossil flowers dating back to 100 mya to those of their present day descendants suggests that ancient and modern flowers may have produced similar essences, including those used in the production of today's perfumes and colognes.","[Poinar, George] Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Poinar, G (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",poinarg@science.oregonstate.edu,,,,,,21,2,3,1,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0891-2963,1029-2381,,HIST BIOL,Hist.

The new material from the Grassy Lake, Alberta, Canada collecting locality also provides evidence that these highly specialised, likely arboreal, ants persisted for an additional 20 million years, reaching the Late Cretaceous. Morphological features of H. cippus, such as the presence of an elongate antennomere II (pedicel), further support the argument that Haidomyrmecini may not actually belong within the subfamily Sphecomyrminae, and may warrant recognition at the subfamily level or inclusion as a highly autapomorphic clade within another subfamily.

In the sub-order Tubulifera, Rohrthrips burmiticus sp. n. is based on a single female with a tubular tenth abdominal segment. This is an exceptionally well-preserved specimen, and details of the mouth parts indicate that the gnathal apparatus of modern Tubulifera was already developed in the Cretaceous.

Here we provide a revision of the Spanish amber springtail fauna, Early Cretaceous (Late Albian) in age, based on 93 specimens sufficiently well preserved to permit specific identification. Three new species are erected within the Isotomidae: Anurophorinae. These are: Burmisotoma spinulifera, new species, Protoisotoma autrigoniensis, new species, and Proisotoma communis, new species. The two former are respectively placed in the Cretaceous genera Burmisotoma Christiansen and Nascimbene (previously known from Cenomanian Burmese amber) and Protoisotoma Christiansen and Pike (in both Burmese and Canadian ambers), while the last species is indistinguishable from the extant, cosmopolitan genus Proisotoma Borner (also recorded in Burmese amber). Low morphological intraspecific variability is described for P. communis. Taxa are discussed in relation to other fossil entomobryomorphan lineages as well as their modern counterparts. A catalog of the known fossil springtails is appended. Isotomidae are diverse springtails, putatively basal among Entomobryomorpha and extending back into the Early Devonian. Indeed, taxa described herein are overall remarkably similar to their extant relatives, emphasizing the antiquity and morphological stasis of the group as a whole.","[Sanchez-Garcia, Alba] Univ Barcelona, Fac Geol, Dept Dinam Terra & Ocea, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain; [Sanchez-Garcia, Alba] Univ Barcelona, Fac Geol, Inst Recerca Biodiversitat IRBio, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain; [Engel, Michael S.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Engel, Michael S.] Nat Hist Museum, New York, NY USA; [Engel, Michael S.] Univ Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA","Sanchez-Garcia, A (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Fac Geol, Dept Dinam Terra & Ocea, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain.; Sanchez-Garcia, A (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Fac Geol, Inst Recerca Biodiversitat IRBio, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain.",,"Engel, Michael S/C-5461-2012","Engel, Michael S/0000-0003-3067-077X; Sanchez-Garcia, Alba/0000-0003-0911-2001",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness; project: Iberian amber: an exceptional record of Cretaceous forests in the rise of modern terrestrial ecosystems [CGL2014-52163],"The authors express their sincere gratitude to the director and staff of the Museo de Ciencias Naturales de Alava for permitting our loan of the Spanish amber specimens discussed herein; to Rafael Lopez del Valle for the careful preparation of the pieces; to Mari-Mutt for information on the disposition of his collection; and to two reviewers for their helpful advice.

New extinct cockroaches of the still living family Blattidae are reported here from the Cretaceous Myanmar amber (99Ma) and are the earliest known inhabitants of complex ant nests, demonstrating that this specialised myrmecophily originated shortly after ant eusociality and appeared in the fossil record. Cretaceous stem aposematic Blattidae are known from the amber of Myanmar and Lebanon and we report them here also from the Syrian amber. Concurrent evolution suggests that the collective internal defence of early ants was weak and allowed infiltrations by numerous unrelated organisms, At the same time, the contemporary presence of ant mimicking myrmecomorphs suggests a need for strong external protection against visually hunting predators. Myrmecophily is supported by morphological adaptations (lack of wide fat body and feeding of adult male; short, fossorial legs; shortened cerci; oligomerised antenna; hairy surface structures) and camouflage behaviour, documented by sediment and own feces covering. Moreover the same piece of amber contains ants, ant mimics and other undescribed ant nest-visiting insects as syninclusions. Another species preserved along with two termites is a putative termitophile. Abundant comparatively large parasitic cockroaches influenced Mesozoic tropical forest ecosystems by affecting the early evolution of complex nests of eusocial insects. Rainforest rudiments in South Yunnan yielded observation of analogical still living, formally undescribed species.","[Vrsansky, Peter] Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Dubravska Cesta 9, Bratislava 84506, Slovakia; [Vrsansky, Peter] Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Phys, Res Ctr Quantum Informat, Dubravska Cesta 9, Bratislava 84511, Slovakia; [Vrsansky, Peter; Barna, Peter] Slovak Acad Sci, Earth Sci Inst, Dubravska Cesta 9,POB 106, Bratislava 84005, Slovakia; [Vrsansky, Peter] Russian Acad Sci, Palaeontol Inst, Profsoyuznaya 123, Moscow 117868, Russia; [Vrsansky, Peter; Ren, Xiaoyin; Lei, Xiaojie; Azar, Dany; Bao, Tong] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Smidova, Lucia] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Inst Geol & Palaeontol, Albertov 6, Prague 12843 2, Czech Republic; [Sendi, Hemen] Comenius Univ, Fac Nat Sci, Illkovicova 6, Bratislava 84104, Slovakia; [Wu, Hao] Zhejiang Museum Nat Hist, 6 West Lake Cultural Sq, Hangzhou 310014, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Azar, Dany] Lebanese Univ, Nat Sci Dept, Fac Sci 2, POB 26110217, Fanar Matn, Lebanon; [Surka, Juraj] Slovak Acad Sci, Earth Sci Inst, Dumbierska 1, Banska Bystrica 97401, Slovakia; [Su, Tao; Deng, Weiyudong; Shen, Xianhui] CAS Menglun, Xishuangbanna Trop Bot Garden, Paleoecol Res Grp, Mengla 666303, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Lv, Jun] Dian Jiang Collect, Baoshan 679100, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Bao, Tong] Steinmann Inst, Abt Palaontol, Nussalee 8, D-53115 Bonn, Germany","Vrsansky, P (corresponding author), Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Dubravska Cesta 9, Bratislava 84506, Slovakia.; Vrsansky, P (corresponding author), Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Phys, Res Ctr Quantum Informat, Dubravska Cesta 9, Bratislava 84511, Slovakia.; Vrsansky, P (corresponding author), Slovak Acad Sci, Earth Sci Inst, Dubravska Cesta 9,POB 106, Bratislava 84005, Slovakia.; Vrsansky, P (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, Palaeontol Inst, Profsoyuznaya 123, Moscow 117868, Russia.; Vrsansky, P (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",geolvrsa@savba.sk; smidoval93@gmail.com; hemenko@gmail.com; geolbarn@savba.sk; mason007343@163.com; xjren@nigpas.ac.cn; xjlei@nigpas.ac.cn; dany.azar@mnhn.fr; surka@savbb.sk; sutao@xtbg.org.cn; 13952088574@163.com; baotongking@gmail.com,"Bechly, Gunter/M-6302-2017; Su, Tao/T-4411-2019; Vrsansky, Peter/ABE-7173-2020; Chen, Huaihai/AAH-8972-2020; Azar, Dany/AAF-7387-2020","Bechly, Gunter/0000-0002-9162-4294; Su, Tao/0000-0002-9148-6127; Chen, Huaihai/0000-0002-2121-1822; Azar, Dany/0000-0002-4485-197X; Surka, Juraj/0000-0002-7632-5771; Smidova, Lucia/0000-0002-5798-7817; Bao, Tong/0000-0001-7510-593X","Slovak Research and Development AgencySlovak Research and Development Agency [APVV-0436-12]; Presidium of the Slovak Academy of Sciences [VEGA0012-14, 2/0042/18]; Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB26000000]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41572010, 41622201, 41688103]","We thank Ing.

They include a cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus and trypanosomatid infection in an adult biting midge (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae), and a nuclear polyhedrosis virus in an adult sand fly (Diptera: Phlebotomidae), both from Early Cretaceous Burmese amber, several types of fungal thalli on the cuticle of an adult mosquito (Culicidae: Diptera), as well as a fungal growth on the prothorax of a fungus gnat (Mycetophilidae: Diptera) in Dominican amber and large tumors in the body cavity of a caterpillar (Lepidoptera) in Mexican amber. These discoveries suggest that insect polyhedrosis viruses were present 100 million years ago and present the possibility that vertebrate arboviruses (especially those in the family Reoviridae) could have evolved from cytoplasmic polyhedrosis viruses infecting biting insects. The flagellates in the Early Cretaceous biting midge represent the first fossil record of monogenetic trypanosomatid infections of arthropods. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

However, three-dimensional feather morphology and evolutionary patterns remain difficult to interpret, due to compression in sedimentary rocks [9, 11]. Recent discoveries in Cretaceous amber from Canada, France, Japan, Lebanon, Myanmar, and the United States [12-18] reveal much finer levels of structural detail, but taxonomic placement is uncertain because plumage is rarely associated with identifiable skeletal material [14]. Here we describe the feathered tail of a non-avialan theropod preserved in mid-Cretaceous (similar to 99 Ma) amber from Kachin State, Myanmar [17], with plumage structure that directly informs the evolutionary developmental pathway of feathers. This specimen provides an opportunity to document pristine feathers in direct association with a putative juvenile coelurosaur, preserving fine morphological details, including the spatial arrangement of follicles and feathers on the body, and micrometer-scale features of the plumage. Many feathers exhibit a short, slender rachis with alternating barbs and a uniform series of contiguous barbules, supporting the developmental hypothesis that barbs already possessed barbules when they fused to form the rachis [19]. Beneath the feathers, carbonized soft tissues offer a glimpse of preservational potential and history for the inclusion; abundant Fe2+ suggests that vestiges of primary hemoglobin and ferritin remain trapped within the tail. The new finding highlights the unique preservation potential of amber for understanding the morphology and evolution of coelurosaurian integumentary structures.","[Xing, Lida] China Univ Geosci, State Key Lab Biogeol & Environm Geol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Xing, Lida; Zhang, Jianping] China Univ Geosci, Sch Earth Sci & Resources, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [McKellar, Ryan C.] Royal Saskatchewan Museum, Regina, SK S4P 4W7, Canada; [McKellar, Ryan C.] Univ Regina, Biol Dept, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada; [Xu, Xing] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Paleontol & Paleoanthropol, Key Lab Vertebrate Evolut & Human Origins, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [Li, Gang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst High Energy Phys, Beijing Synchrotron Radiat Facil, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Bai, Ming] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Persons, W.

The new species represent the families Othniodellithidae and Aulacidae, both previously recorded from Burmese amber. Xenodellitha preta, new genus and species, is the second othniodellithid wasp and the diagnosis of the family is slightly emended in order to accommodate this species. The subfamily Hyptiogastritinae (Aulacidae) is expanded to include Protofoenus Cockerell and a third genus from Burmese amber. Archeofoenus tartaricus, new genus and species, is the third known species of the extinct aulacid subfamily Hyptiogastritinae, differing from Hyptiogastrites electrinus Cockerell in the low position of the discal cell and the open subdiscal cell in the forewing, and from Protofoenus swinhoei Cockerell in the form of the head and mandible, coloration, and forewing venational details. Together, Archeofoenus and Protofoenus are placed in Archeofoenini, new tribe. The last species is similar to the genus Electrofoenus Cockerell, and together they are classified in Electrofoenini among the Aulacidae. Electrofoenops diminuta, new genus and species, is distinguished from Electrofoenus on the basis of wing venation.

Burmomerope shares with the three living species several distinctive, derived features of the antenna, wing, as well as the uniquely large, forcipate male terminalia. Burmomerope plesiomorphically possesses fewer crossveins (though this may be related to its small size), and possibly ocelli; its robust rostrum may be either plesiomorphic or apomorphic. Burmomerope appears to be a stem-group meropeid probably more closely related to the living species than is Boreomerope.

However, histol-ogy and preservation of plants entombed in Cretaceous ambers remain poorly known. We report an exquisitely preserved conifer leafy axis from 100-million-year-old opaque amber of western France that is assignable to Glenrosa carentonensis Moreau, Neraudeau, Tafforeau & Depre. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the taphonomy and the use of microtomography for studies of palaeobotanical remains in amber. Methods A leafy axis was examined using propagation phase-contrast X-ray synchrotron microtomography with voxel sizes of 14.9, 1.4, and 0.7 mu m. Key Results The conifer leafy axis described is preserved in three dimensions. Despite desiccation of the speci-men within the surrounding amber, the cuticle, as well as most of inner tissues, is preserved in three dimensions down to the cellular level. Epidermis, palisade parenchyma, spongy parenchyma, transfusion tracheids and vascular bundles are clearly distinguished. Conclusions Gross morphology and histology of the specimen were revealed using synchrotron microtomogra-phy, allowing an unprecedented resolution for the study of soft-bodied plants entombed in amber. The study reveals a peculiar combination of authigenic and duripartic preservation as well as permineralization, and highlights the complexity of taphonomic processes that can occur in amber inclusions. This fossil demonstrates the difficulty of studying amber-preserved plant remains under certain conditions.","[Moreau, Jean-David; Neraudeau, Didier; Perrichot, Vincent] Univ Rennes 1, CNRS, UMR Geosci Rennes 6118, Campus Beaulieu Bat 15,263 Ave Gen Leclerc, F-35042 Rennes, France; [Tafforeau, Paul] European Synchrotron Radiat Facil, 71 Ave Martyrs, F-38000 Grenoble, France","Moreau, JD (corresponding author), Univ Rennes 1, CNRS, UMR Geosci Rennes 6118, Campus Beaulieu Bat 15,263 Ave Gen Leclerc, F-35042 Rennes, France.",jean.david.moreau@gmail.com,"Perrichot, Vincent/I-4134-2019; MOREAU, Jean-David/AAH-4652-2019","Perrichot, Vincent/0000-0002-7973-0430; Tafforeau, Paul/0000-0002-5962-1683; MOREAU, Jean-David/0000-0003-2978-5983",Geosciences Rennes [CNRS-UMR6118]; European Synchrotron Radiation Facility; French National Research AgencyFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [BLAN07-1-184190],"We thank Alain Couillard for providing the amber piece containing the specimen described here, and Malvina Lak for contributing to synchrotron imaging and for original discovery of the specimen.

Consequently, tracking mouthpart innovation in insects is one of the keys toward understanding their diversification. In hemipteroid insects (clade Paraneoptera or Acercaria: lice, thrips, aphids, cicadas, bugs, etc.), the transition from chewing to piercing-and-sucking mouthparts is widely regarded as the turning point that enabled hyperdiversification of the Hemiptera, the fifth largest insect order. However, the transitional process from chewing to piercing-and-sucking in the Paraneoptera was hitherto completely unknown. In this paper, we report a well preserved mid Cretaceous amber fossil of the paraneopteran insect family Archipsyllidae and describe it as Mydiognathus eviohlhoffae gen. et sp. n. This species has elongate mandibles and styliform laciniae similar to Hemiptera but retains functional chewing mouthparts. A number of morphological characters place the Archipsyllidae as the sister group of the thrips plus hemipterans, which strongly suggests that the mouthparts of M. eviohlhoffae represent a transitional condition from primitive chewing to derived piercing-and-sucking mouthparts. The clade composed of Archipsyllidae, thrips, and hemipterans is here named Pancondylognatha, a new supra-ordinal taxon. Based on newly obtained information, we also assess the monophyly of the Paraneoptera, which was called into question by recent phylogenomic analyses. A phylogenetic analysis that includes Mydiognathus strongly supports the monophyly of the Paraneoptera.","[Yoshizawa, Kazunori] Hokkaido Univ, Sch Agr, Systemat Entomol, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608589, Japan; [Lienhard, Charles] Nat Hist Museum City Geneva, CP 6434, CH-1211 Geneva 6, Switzerland","Yoshizawa, K (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Sch Agr, Systemat Entomol, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608589, Japan.",psocid@res.agr.hokudai.ac.jp,"Yoshizawa, Kazunori/Q-9390-2019; Yoshizawa, Kazunori/A-4268-2012","Yoshizawa, Kazunori/0000-0001-6170-4296; ","JSPSMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [15H04409]","We thank Rainer Ohlhoff for giving us the opportunity to examine this exceptionally valuable amber fossil for this study and John Hollier for discussion and language editing.

Assessment of the genetic diversity of the PfK13 ortholog PvK12 in Plasmodium vivax field samples from the same hotspots of P. falciparum artemisinin resistance revealed a limited genetic diversity of PvK12. Following the same logic, we analyzed genetic variations of the PvPI3K gene in 188 P. vivax field isolates from two geographic locations along the China-Myanmar border. Overall, high genetic diversity of PvPI3K was observed; parasites from Yunnan's Tengchong County had higher genetic diversity than those from Laiza Township, Kachin State, Myanmar. Almost all the neutrality tests applied detected statistically significant deviation from zero. The negative Tajima's D values in both populations implicated that PvPI3K gene might have experienced either a directional selection or an expansion in population size. There was low linkage disequilibrium between the PvPI3K mutations in both populations, suggesting the existence of large, almost panmictic, parasite populations that enabled effective recombination. This later result was confirmed by the detection of a minimum of five recombination events in each population with two major breakpoints. Multiple tests for selection confirmed a signature of purifying selection on PvPI3K. All the amino acid mutations were predicted to be neutral for the PI3K protein's function. These findings provide insights on the genetic diversity of P. vivax populations along the China-Myanmar border.","[Mbenda, Huguette Gaelle Ngassa; Siddiqui, Faiza Amber; Cui, Liwang] Penn State Univ, Dept Entomol, 501 ASI Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Zeng, Weilin; Bai, Yao; Yang, Zhaoqing] Kunming Med Univ, Dept Pathogen Biol & Immunol, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China","Cui, LW (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Entomol, 501 ASI Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.; Yang, ZQ (corresponding author), Kunming Med Univ, Dept Pathogen Biol & Immunol, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China.",zhaoqingy92@hotmail.com; luc2@psu.edu,"Siddiqui, Faiza Amber/Q-2191-2015",,"talent introduction project of Yunnan province [2013HA026]; National Institutes of Health, USAUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [U19AI089672]; National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [U1202226, 31260508]; FOGARTY INTERNATIONAL CENTERUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC) [D43TW006571] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [U19AI089672] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This work was supported by the talent introduction project of Yunnan province (# 2013HA026) and National Institutes of Health, USA (U19AI089672).

One major lineage, Aneuretopsychina, consists of four families plus two haustellate clades, Diptera and Siphonaptera. One clade, Pseudopolycentropodidae, from mid-Cretaceous Myanmar amber, contains Parapolycentropus. Here, we newly establish Dualula, assigned to Dualulidae, constituting the fifth lineage. Parapolycentropus and Dualula lineages are small, two-winged, with unique siphonate mouthparts for imbibing pollination drops. A cibarial pump provides siphonal food inflow; in Dualula, the siphon base surrounds a hypopharynx housing a small, valved pump constricted to a narrow salivary duct supplying outgoing enzymes for food fluidization. Indirect evidence links long-proboscid mouthpart structure with contemporaneous tubulate ovulate organs. Direct evidence of gymnospermous Cycadopites pollen is associated with one Parapolycentropus specimen. Parapolycentropus and Dualula exhibit hind-wing reduction that would precede haltere formation, likely caused by Ultrabithorax. Distinctive, male Aneuretopsychina genitalia are evident from specimens in copulo, supplemented by mixed-sex individuals of likely male mating swarms.","[Lin, Xiaodan; Labandeira, Conrad C.; Shih, Chungkun; Ren, Dong] Capital Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China; [Lin, Xiaodan; Labandeira, Conrad C.; Shih, Chungkun; Hotton, Carol L.] Smithsonian Inst, Dept Paleobiol, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Washington, DC 20013 USA; [Labandeira, Conrad C.] Univ Maryland, Dept Entomol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Hotton, Carol L.] Natl Lib Med, Natl Ctr Biotechnol Informat, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA","Labandeira, CC; Ren, D (corresponding author), Capital Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China.; Labandeira, CC (corresponding author), Smithsonian Inst, Dept Paleobiol, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Washington, DC 20013 USA.; Labandeira, CC (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Entomol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",labandec@si.edu; rendong@mail.cnu.edu.cn,,"Ren, Dong/0000-0001-8660-0901","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31730087, 41688103, 31672323]; Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in UniversityProgram for Changjiang Scholars & Innovative Research Team in University (PCSIRT) [IRT-17R75]; Support Project of High-level Teachers in Beijing Municipal Universities [IDHT20180518]; Graduate Student Program for International Exchange and Joint Supervision at Capital Normal University [028175534000]; Intramural Research Program of the National Institutes of Health, National Library of Medicine of the United States","We thank Matthew L.

These are predators with mouthparts modified into venom-injecting stylets. These stylets can take various forms, especially in relation to their body. Especially large stylets are known in larva of the neuropteran ingroups Osmylidae (giant lacewings or lance lacewings) and Sisyridae (spongilla flies). Here the stylets are straight, the bodies are rather slender. In the better known larvae of Myrmeleontidae (ant lions) and their relatives (e.g. owlflies, Ascalaphidae) stylets are curved and bear numerous prominent teeth. Here the stylets can also reach large sizes; the body and especially the head are relatively broad. We here describe a new type of larva from Burmese amber (100 million years old) with very prominent curved stylets, yet body and head are rather slender. Such a combination is unknown in the modern fauna. We provide a comparison with other fossil neuropteran larvae that show some similarities with the new larva. The new larva is unique in processing distinct protrusions on the trunk segments. Also the ratio of the length of the stylets vs. the width of the head is the highest ratio among all neuropteran larvae with curved stylets and reaches values only found in larvae with straight mandibles. We discuss possible phylogenetic systematic interpretations of the new larva and aspects of the diversity of neuropteran larvae in the Cretaceous.","[Haug, Joachim T.; Haug, Carolin] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Biol 2, Bioctr, Grosshaderner Str 2, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany; [Haug, Joachim T.; Haug, Carolin] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, GeoBioctr, Richard Wagner Str 10, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Mueller, Patrick] Friedhofstr 9, D-66894 Kashofen, Germany","Haug, JT (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Biol 2, Bioctr, Grosshaderner Str 2, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany.; Haug, JT (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, GeoBioctr, Richard Wagner Str 10, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",joachim.haug@palaeo-evo-devo.info,,,Volkswagen FoundationVolkswagen; LMUexcellent Junior Researcher Fund,"The Volkswagen Foundation kindly funds JTH with a Lichtenberg Professorship.

The studied assemblage originated from the Late Albian (Early Cretaceous) deposit of Archingeay-Les Nouillers in southwestern France. Phase-contrast X-ray synchrotron imaging, a technique recently developed for analysing amber inclusions, is used here for the first time to reconstruct very detailed views of two cockroach specimens fossilised in a piece of opaque amber. The Blattulidae Vishniakova, 1982, here represented by Batola. nikolai n. gen., n. sp. and Globula lake n. gen., n. sp. were, analogically as in sedimentary record, dominant; Liberiblattinidae Vrsansky, 2002, represented by Leptolythica vincenti n. gen., n. sp.; and Mesoblattinidae Handlirsch, 1906, represented by Sivis odpo n. gen., n. sp. were subdominant; the new family Eadiidae n. fam., with Eadia aidae n. gen., n. sp. occurs only in the present and Myanmar ambers; and a new, here not described family is yet only indigenous to this locality. Caloblattinidae Vrsansky & Ansorge, 2000 are rare apparently due to their large size and thus low resin-burial potential, in spite of their fairly common occurrence in the Late Mesozoic assemblages of rock fossil. The present assemblage considerably differs from the standard conservative worldwide Early Cretaceous assemblages of imprint fossils. In spite of alternative taxonomic composition at generic level, however, and due to the particular burial conditions in amber, this association is of a comparable, rather low, specific diversity.","[Vrsansky, Peter] Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Geol, Dubravska C 9,POB 106, Bratislava 84005, Slovakia; [Vrsansky, Peter] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Paleontol, Moscow 117868, Russia","Vrsansky, P (corresponding author), Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Geol, Dubravska C 9,POB 106, Bratislava 84005, Slovakia.",geolvrsa@savba.sk,"Vrsansky, Peter/ABE-7173-2020",,Agence nationale de la Recherche (ANR)French National Research Agency (ANR) [BLAN07-1-184190],"I thank Vincent Perrichot and Didier Neraudeau for organizing the Study, and for preparation of preliminary documentation and specimens.

The new genus lacks the apparent forewing intramedian cell, and possesses three character states not found in other Chrysopinae: the simple AA1, the short basal crossvein between M and Cu, and 5-6 rings of setae on the antennal flagellomeres. This genus is probably a specialised form in a basal branch of Chrysopinae, that could not be attributed to any of the known tribes. The specimen of Nothochrysa? sp. consists only of fragments of the forewings. The late Eocene Baltic amber represents the oldest horizon where Chrysopinae and Nothochrysinae are found to coexist.

A total of 30 families from Spain and 16 families from France have been identified (with almost twice bioinclusions identified in Spain than in France); 13 of these families have their most ancient representatives within these ambers. A similar study had previously only been performed on Lebanese ambers (Barremian in age and Gondwanan in origin), recording 36 coleopteran families. Few lists of taxa were available for Myanmar (Burmese) amber (early Cenomanian in age and Laurasian in origin). Coleopteran families found in Cretaceous ambers share with their modern relatives mainly saproxylic and detritivorous habits in the larval or adult stages, rather than wood-boring behavior. Fifteen of the coleopteran families occur in both the Lebanese and Spanish ambers; while only five are present in both Spanish and French. Considering the paleogeographic proximity and similarity of age of the Spanish and French ambers, the small number of taxa found in common at both areas is surprising. The ancient origin for the Lebanese and Spanish ambers, the paleogeography (including some barriers for terrestrial biota) and the local paleohabitats are factors that may explain the dissimilarity with the French specimens. Wildfires are believed to be a more likely cause of resin production during the Cretaceous than infestation by beetles. Current knowledge of the beetle species found in the Cretaceous ambers is introduced. (C) 2016, China University of Geosciences (Beijing) and Peking University.

Oropsini trib. nov. differs from the tribes Paleocartini, Selengarhynchini and Metrioxenoidini in the transversely oval and separated procoxal cavities, weakly convex and oval eyes, and the trochanters completely separating femora and coxae.

However, the latter is of major importance for ant relationships, as it is considered the most basal subfamily. Therefore, each new discovery of a Mesozoic ant is of high interest for improving our understanding of their early history and basal relationships. In this paper, a new sphecomyrmine ant, allied to the Burmese amber genus Haidomyrmex, is described from mid-Cretaceous amber of France as Haidomyrmodes mammuthus gen. and sp. n. The diagnosis of the tribe Haidomyrmecini is emended based on the new type material, which includes a gyne (alate female) and two incomplete workers. The genus Sphecomyrmodes, hitherto known by a single species from Burmese amber, is also reported and a new species described as S. occidentalis sp. n. after two workers remarkably preserved in a single piece of Early Cenomanian French amber. The new fossils provide additional information on early ant diversity and relationships and demonstrate that the monophyly of the Sphecomyrminae, as currently defined, is still weakly supported.","[Perrichot, Vincent] Humboldt Univ, Museum Naturkunde, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Nel, Andre] CNRS, UMR 5202, Museum Natl Hist Nat, F-75005 Paris, France; [Neraudeau, Didier] Univ Rennes 1, CNRS, UMR 6118, F-35042 Rennes, France; [Lacau, Sebastien] Univ Estadual Sudoeste Bahia, DEBI, Lab Zool & Parasitol Anim, BR-45700000 Itapetinga, Bahia, Brazil; [Guyot, Thierry] Univ La Rochelle, Inst Mer, LBEM, F-17000 La Rochelle, France","Perrichot, V (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Museum Naturkunde, Invalidenstr 43, D-10115 Berlin, Germany.",vincent.perrichot@neuf.fr,"Perrichot, Vincent/I-4134-2019","Perrichot, Vincent/0000-0002-7973-0430",,,,31,43,47,0,8,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0028-1042,1432-1904,,NATURWISSENSCHAFTEN,Naturwissenschaften,FEB,2008,95,2,,,,,91,97,,10.1007/s00114-007-0302-7,,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,248YI,WOS:000252192700002,17828384,,,,2021-07-18

The amber has been analyzed by means of optical microscopic methods, infrared spectroscopy, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, and pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry to understand the amber composition, origin, taphonomy, alteration, and diagenesis. Organic petrographic and reflectance analyses of organic matter from amber-bearing sediment was carried out to get information about paleoenvironment and maturity of sedimentary rock. Analyses confirmed polylabdane structure associated with Class Ib-type of amber and its possible origin from the conifer family Araucariaceae. It is characterized by a high degree of maturity, where both temperature and exogenic processes have participated in its conversion. Heterogeneity of reflectance values in the resinite suggests that amber was not redeposited from an older and more mature sedimentary unit. The discrepancy between the maturity of the amber and amber-bearing sedimentary rock, along with abundant char and inertinite macerals indicates a probability of thermal alteration of the amber under the influence of heat from a wildfire and increased maturity occurring before its ultimate burial in a deep-sea environment. The assemblage of terrigenous macerals and numerous char and inertinite particles which were found in amber-bearing sediment, as well as in the amber crust, suggest forest-swamp type vegetation affected by wildfires. The presence of amber and predominantly terrigenous organic matter, besides mud rip-up clasts derived from freshwater sediments in deep-marine deposits, indicates a direct connection of terrestrial environments to the deep-water depositional system.","[Kotulova, Julia; Starek, Dusan] Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Earth Sci, Dubravska Cesta 9, Bratislava 84005, Slovakia; [Havelcova, Martina] Czech Acad Sci, Inst Rock Struct & Mech, V Holesovickach 41, Prague 18209 8, Czech Republic; [Palkova, Helena] Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Inorgan Chem, Dubravska Cesta 9, Bratislava 84536, Slovakia","Kotulova, J (corresponding author), Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Earth Sci, Dubravska Cesta 9, Bratislava 84005, Slovakia.",julia.kotulova@savba.sk,"Kotulova, Julia/AAO-5789-2020; Palkova, Helena/AAB-4194-2021","Kotulova, Julia/0000-0002-6209-2532; Palkova, Helena/0000-0003-2687-3494; Havelcova, Martina/0000-0002-7585-3580",VEGA agencyVedecka grantova agentura MSVVaS SR a SAV (VEGA) [2/0014/18],"This work was supported by the VEGA agency (Project 2/0014/18).

To date, only a single fossil jacobsoniid has been described, from Eocene Baltic amber (similar to 40 Ma). Here, we push back the oldest definitive record of Jacobsoniidae by approximately 60 million years with a new fossil species recovered from mid-Cretaceous (similar to 99 Ma) Burmese amber from Myanmar. Remarkably, exploration of the fossil's morphology with confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that it belongs to an extant genus, Derolathrus. The similarity of the new taxon, Derolathrus abyssus n. sp., to modern congeners provides a striking example of morphological stability over deep evolutionary time-a possible outcome of long-term persistence of mesic microhabitats, a hypothesis we argue is supported by a variety of other Recent, litter-inhabiting arthropod taxa now known to be largely unchanged since the Mesozoic. Many such examples belong to the Staphylinoidea-a hyperdiverse beetle superfamily that dominates contemporary mesic habitats, and with which Jacobsoniidae may have a close phylogenetic relationship.

Here we describe a new taxon of Corydasialidae - Megalopteroneura chenxingi gen. et sp. nov. - based on an exquisitely preserved specimen in mid-Cretaceous (Albian-Cenomanian) amber of Myanmar. The new corydasialid in general resembles the genus Cratochrysa Martins-Neto, 1994 (Neuroptera: familia incertae sedis) from the Early Cretaceous Crato Formation of Brazil. In light of the new fossil evidence, Corydasialidae is herein transferred from Megaloptera to Neuroptera based on sharing the following autapomorphies of the latter order: orthognathous head, absence of gula, distinctly enlarged prementum of labium, and short forewing ScA terminating on ScP. Male genitalia of M. chenxingi gen. et sp. nov. are superficially Raphidioptera-like, with well-developed male gonocoxites and gonapophyses 9 but lacking rosette of trichobothria on ectoprocts. However, male genital characters of the new corydasialid differ fundamentally from Raphidioptera in the separation of tergum and sternum 9, fusion between tergum 9 and ectoprocts, and fusion between sterna 8 and 9. These genital features, together with some wing characters, suggest a possible close relationship between Corydasialidae and Chrysopidae or Mesochrysopidae. The new corydasialid fossil, representing the first extinct lacewing family with completely preserved male genitalia, provides insight into the comparative morphology of genital sclerites in Neuropterida, and further elucidates the early evolution of lacewings.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:FD949294-59E3-455E-AABA-3E10D9B582D6","[Liu, Xingyue; Lu, Xiumei] China Agr Univ, Dept Entomol, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Weiwei] Three Gorges Entomol Museum, POB 4680, Chongqing 400015, Peoples R China","Liu, XY (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Dept Entomol, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",xingyue_liu@yahoo.com,"Liu, Xingyue/A-3019-2013","Liu, Xingyue/0000-0002-9168-0659; Lu, Xiumei/0000-0002-3494-7871","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31322501, 41271063]",We thank Ulrike Aspock (Vienna) and an anonymous reviewer who kindly provided valuable comments to help improve the manuscript.

These feathers in amber reveal a unique ventrally concave and dorsoventrally thin rachis, and a dorsal groove (sometimes pigmented) that we identify as the medial stripe visible in many rachis-dominated rectrices of Mesozoic birds. The distally pennaceous portion of these feathers shows differentiated proximal and distal barbules, the latter with hooklets forming interlocking barbs. Micro-CT scans and transverse sections demonstrate the absence of histodifferentiated cortex and medullary pith of the rachis and barb rami. The highly differentiated barbules combined with the lack of obvious histodifferentiation of the barb rami or rachis suggests that these feathers could have been formed without the full suite and developmental interplay of intermediate filament alpha keratins and corneous beta-proteins that is employed in the cornification process of modern feathers. This study thus highlights how the development of these feathers might have differed from that of their modern counterparts, namely in the morphogenesis of the ventral components of the rachis and barb rami. We suggest that the concave ventral surface of the rachis of these Cretaceous feathers is not homologous with the ventral groove of modern rachises. Our study of these Burmese feathers also confirms previous claims, based on two-dimensional fossils, that they correspond to an extinct morphotype and it cautions about the common practice of extrapolating developmental aspects (and mechanical attributes) of modern feathers to those of stem birds (and their dinosaurian outgroups) because the latter need not to have developed through identical pathways.","[Carroll, Nathan R.; Chiappe, Luis M.] Nat Hist Museum Los Angeles Cty, Dinosaur Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA; [Carroll, Nathan R.; Bottjer, David J.] Univ Southern Calif, Dept Earth Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA","Carroll, NR (corresponding author), Nat Hist Museum Los Angeles Cty, Dinosaur Inst, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA.; Carroll, NR (corresponding author), Univ Southern Calif, Dept Earth Sci, Los Angeles, CA 90089 USA.",ncarroll@nhm.org,,,,,,41,3,3,0,1,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,LONDON,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,DEC 2,2019,9,,,,,,,,18108,10.1038/s41598-019-54429-y,,,8,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,JS8MY,WOS:000500557200001,31792276,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2021-07-18

These remains are often referred in literature as Indonesian amber, Borneo amber or simply as dammar. They are very common in the region and the Brunei Sultanate is no exception as most of its Neogene sedimentary successions contain amber-rich layers. Although amber is a common fossil in the country and in northern Borneo, to our knowledge it has not been studied in great detail so far. Here we present an account on the Borneo Ambers from Brunei, regarding their stratigraphic origin, basic physical properties, their interaction with the biosphere and their botanical origin using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Additionally, a number of ambers and modem tree resins were analysed for their carbon isotope composition and a few were tested with gas chromatography. We discuss the results in a regional and global context, in comparison with available data from the IAA. The ambers come from four different lithostratigraphic units with an age range of 12 to 3 million years (middle Miocene to Pliocene). Recently reworked ambers from the coast, ambers from younger alluvial deposits, and several modern tree resins from Dipterocarpaceae and Araucariaceae (Agathis borneensis) were also included in the study. The > 60 FTIR analyses of modem and fossil specimens suggest that all the Brunei ambers were produced by trees of Dipterocarpaceae. There is no indication of Agathis in the fossil record, in agreement with their lower abundance in the forests of Borneo. Modern and fossil dipterocarp resins were found to be different based on the following criteria: (1) Different reactions to solubility, hot needle and UV tests with faster reaction time and less fluorescence for the modern ones; (2) Clear distinction based on certain FTIR absorbance band ratios, mostly by those that represent carboxylic acids and esters (e.g., similar to 1700 and 1243 cm(-1)); (3) Modern resin yielded on an average 3%o lower delta C-13 values, (4) Gas chromatography data reflect maturation differences among the samples. Although there is some overlap in the chemical results between the two groups, generally all these differences reflect different maturation stages of the resinous material and point towards loss of low delta C-13 components from the organic structure of the resin. The minor timewise decreasing trend in average delta C-13 from the late middle Miocene to late Miocene can be explained by (1) gradual changes in local environmental conditions, and/or (2) increased amount of less mature specimens among the younger samples. In contrast, the highest obtained delta C-13 values were found in the youngest Pliocene ambers. Instead of maturation bias this can be linked to environmental factors such as cooler-drier climate with increased seasonality, probably reflecting the onset of the northern hemisphere glaciation.","[Kocsis, Laszlo; Hassan, Syaimaa' Haji; Jumat, Nurhazwana] Univ Brunei Darussalam, Fac Sci, Geol Grp, Jalan Tungku Link, BE-1410 Gadong, Brunei; [Usman, Anwar; Daud, Dalina] Univ Brunei Darussalam, Fac Sci, Chem Dept, Jalan Tungku Link, BE-1410 Gadong, Brunei; [Jourdan, Anne-Lise] UCL, Bloomsbury Environm Isotope Facil, Gower St, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Briguglio, Antonino] Univ Genoa, Dipartimento Sci Terra Ambiente & Vita, DI STAV, Corsa Europa 26, I-16132 Genoa, Italy; [Slik, Ferry] Univ Brunei Darussalam, Fac Sci, Environm & Life Sci Dept, Jalan Tungku Link, BE-1410 Gadong, Brunei; [Rinyu, Laszlo; Futo, Istvan] Hungarian Acad Sci, Inst Nucl Res, Isotope Climatol & Environm Res Ctr ICER, Debrecen, Hungary","Kocsis, L (corresponding author), Univ Brunei Darussalam, Fac Sci, Geol Grp, Jalan Tungku Link, BE-1410 Gadong, Brunei.",laszlokocsis@hotmail.com,,"Kocsis, Laszlo/0000-0003-4613-1850","Universiti Brunei Darussalam [UBD/PNC2/2/RG/1(325), UBD/PNC2/2/RG/1(326)]; European UnionEuropean Commission; State of Hungary; European Regional Development FundEuropean Commission [GINOP-2.3.2.-15-2016-00009 'ICER']","We are very grateful to Jonathan Hobley, Barbara Kosmowska-Ceranowicz and Siti Nur Faezah H.

Marine macroscopic inclusions are also very rare and were recently described from Cretaceous Burmese amber and Early Miocene Mexican amber. Whereas a coastal setting for the amber source forests is generally proposed, different scenarios have been suggested to explain how these marine inclusions can become trapped in a resin of terrestrial origin. These scenarios include an introduction of marine organisms (i) through high tides, (ii) from storms and resulting in flooding of the littoral/estuarine forest floor, (iii) in resin dropped into the sea in mangrove-type settings, or (iv) by wind and sea spray. We investigated the possibility of a wind-driven introduction of marine microorganisms into tree resins using modern coastal conifer forests with the highly resinous Cook pine (Araucaria columnaris) in New Caledonia as a model for the Cretaceous amber forests from France. By exposing fresh resin surfaces on the seaward side of the trees and the collection of older in situ resins, we confirmed that marine microorganisms can become trapped on sea-exposed resin, along with remnants from terrestrial organisms, and salt crystals. We suggest that, for cases where only a few marine inclusions are discovered in an amber deposit, an origin from aeolian background deposition is feasible. However, a more energetic but possibly still aeolian event is likely needed to explain the high numbers of marine microorganisms embedded in pieces of Cretaceous amber from France.","[Schmidt, Alexander R.; Grabow, Dennis; Beimforde, Christina; Thiel, Volker; Seyfullah, Leyla J.] Univ Gottingen, Dept Geobiol, Gottingen, Germany; [Perrichot, Vincent] Univ Rennes, CNRS, Geosci Rennes UMR 6118, Rennes, France; [Rikkinen, Jouko] Univ Helsinki, Finnish Museum Nat Hist, Helsinki, Finland; [Rikkinen, Jouko] Univ Helsinki, Fac Biol & Environm Sci, Helsinki, Finland; [Saint Martin, Simona] Museum Natl Hist Nat, Dept Origines & Evolut, UMR MNHN CNRS SU CR2P 7207, Paris, France","Schmidt, AR; Seyfullah, LJ (corresponding author), Univ Gottingen, Dept Geobiol, Gottingen, Germany.",alexander.schmidt@geo.uni-goettingen.de; leyla.seyfullah@geo.uni-goettingen.de,"Perrichot, Vincent/I-4134-2019; Rikkinen, Jouko/AAM-8732-2021","Perrichot, Vincent/0000-0002-7973-0430; Thiel, Volker/0000-0003-4758-2784; Seyfullah, Leyla/0000-0002-0199-9923; Rikkinen, Jouko/0000-0002-4615-6639",OSUR (Univ.

We present the first Cretaceous fossil of the predominantly epiphytic leafy liverwort genus Radula in ca. 100 Myr old Burmese amber. The fossil's exquisite preservation allows first insights into the morphology of early crown group representatives of Radula occurring in gymnosperm-dominated forests. Ancestral character state reconstruction aligns the fossil with the crown group of Radula subg. Odontoradula; however, corresponding divergence time estimates using the software BEAST lead to unrealistically old age estimates. Alternatively, assignment of the fossil to the stem of subg. Odontoradula results in a stem age estimate of Radula of 227.8Ma (95% highest posterior density (HPD): 165.7-306.7) and a crown group estimate of 176.3Ma (135.1-227.4), in agreement with analyses employing standard substitution rates (stem age 235.6 Ma (142.9-368.5), crown group age 183.8 Ma (109.9-289.1)). The fossil likely belongs to the stem lineage of Radula subg. Odontoradula. The fossil's modern morphology suggests that switches from gymnosperm to angiosperm phorophytes occurred without changes in plant body plans in epiphytic liverworts. The fossil provides evidence for striking morphological homoplasy in time. Even conservative node assignments of the fossil support older rather than younger age estimates of the Radula crown group, involving origins for most extant subgenera by the end of the Cretaceous and diversification of their crown groups in the Cenozoic.","[Bechteler, Julia; Perez-Escobar, Oscar Alejandro; Feldberg, Kathrin; Heinrichs, Jochen] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Biol & GeoBioctr, Menzinger Str 67, D-80638 Munich, Germany; [Schmidt, Alexander R.] Georg August Univ, Dept Geobiol, Goldschmidtstr 3, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Renner, Matthew A.

Among a diversity of vertebrates, seven specimens that preserve the skeletal remains of enantiornithine birds have previously been described(1,4-8), all of which (including at least one seemingly mature specimen) are smaller than specimens recovered from lithic materials. Here we describe an exceptionally well-preserved and diminutive bird-like skull that documents a new species, which we name Oculudentavis khaungraae gen. et sp. nov. The find appears to represent the smallest known dinosaur of the Mesozoic era, rivalling the bee hummingbird (Mellisuga helenae)-the smallest living bird-in size. The O. khaungraae specimen preserves features that hint at miniaturization constraints, including a unique pattern of cranial fusion and an autapomorphic ocular morphology(9) that resembles the eyes of lizards. The conically arranged scleral ossicles define a small pupil, indicative of diurnal activity. Miniaturization most commonly arises in isolated environments, and the diminutive size of Oculudentavis is therefore consistent with previous suggestions that this amber formed on an island within the Trans-Tethyan arc(10). The size and morphology of this species suggest a previously unknown bauplan, and a previously undetected ecology. This discovery highlights the potential of amber deposits to reveal the lowest limits of vertebrate body size.","[Xing, Lida] China Univ Geosci, State Key Lab Biogeol & Environm Geol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xing, Lida] China Univ Geosci, Sch Earth Sci & Resources, Beijing, Peoples R China; [O'Connor, Jingmai K.] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Paleontol & Paleoanthropol, Key Lab Vertebrate Evolut & Human Origins, Beijing, Peoples R China; [O'Connor, Jingmai K.] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Schmitz, Lars; Chiappe, Luis M.] Nat Hist Museum Los Angeles Cty, Dinosaur Inst, Los Angeles, CA USA; [Schmitz, Lars] Claremont Mckenna Coll, WM Keck Sci Dept, Claremont, CA 91711 USA; [Schmitz, Lars] Scripps Coll, WM Keck Sci Dept, Claremont, CA 91711 USA; [Schmitz, Lars] Pitzer Coll, WM Keck Sci Dept, Claremont, CA 91711 USA; [McKellar, Ryan C.] Royal Saskatchewan Museum, Regina, SK, Canada; [McKellar, Ryan C.] Univ Regina, Dept Biol, Regina, SK, Canada; [Yi, Qiru; Li, Gang] Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing Adv Sci & Innovat Ctr, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Li, Gang] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst High Energy Phys, Beijing, Peoples R China","O'Connor, JK (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Paleontol & Paleoanthropol, Key Lab Vertebrate Evolut & Human Origins, Beijing, Peoples R China.; O'Connor, JK (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, Beijing, Peoples R China.",jingmai@ivpp.ac.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41888101, 41790455, 41772008]; National Geographic SocietyNational Geographic Society [EC0768-15]; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR [2015-00681]","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (no. 41888101, 41790455 and 41772008), the National Geographic Society (no.

Amberocula gen. nov., is the third genus of Ripidiini documented from the Upper Cretaceous (lowermost Cenomanian) amber of northern Myanmar. Three species are included in the genus: Amberocula muelleri sp. nov. (type species), A. costata sp. nov., and A. fallax sp. nov. Amberocula is represented by six single male inclusions and one quadruple male syninclusion (for A. muelleri). The genus is distinguishable by the combination of number and shape of antennomeres and tarsomeres, reduced mouthparts, and shape of the head, compound eyes, and thorax relative to all extant and fossil members of the tribe Ripidiini. In addition, three single male inclusions and one syninclusion of six males indistinguishable from Paleoripiphorus deploegi Perrichot, Nel, and Neraudeau (Ripidiini) are reported. Described syninclusions of both genera support the previous assumption of aggregative-like behavior of male Ripidiini may be a groundplan feature of the tribe and responsible for the presence of such syninclusions. Two monotypic genera, Plesiotoma alissae gen. et sp. nov. and Burmitoma nalae gen. et sp. nov., are representative of the subfamily Pelecotominae and are also described and figured. The inclusions represent the second and third definitive records for the subfamily in Cretaceous amber, and also the discovery of fossil pelecotomine females. They differ from the contemporaneous Flabellotoma Batelka, Prokop and Engel in the presence of more complete tibial spur formulas and the absence of a ventral abdominal microsclerite. The presence of three species of Amberocula, additional material of P. deploegi, and two new genera of Pelecotominae demonstrates a surprising abundance of ripiphorids in Cretaceous amber, and we provide comments on the past diversity of this parasitoid family during the period, as well as observations on the nature of their preservation and paleoethology. The known diversity of Mesozoic Tenebrionoidea is cataloged and a key to the Cretaceous diversity of Ripiphoridae is presented. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Deducing the factors that drove pselaphine diversification and their evolutionary predisposition to inquilinism requires a reliable timescale of pselaphine cladogenesis. Pselaphinae is split into a small and highly plesiomorphic supertribe, Faronitae, and its sister group, the higher Pselaphinae' - a vast multi-tribe clade with a more derived morphological ground plan, and which includes all known instances of inquilinism. The higher Pselaphinae is dominated by tribes with a Gondwanan taxonomic bias. However, a minority of tribes are limited to the Nearctic and Palearctic ecozones, implying a potentially older, Pangaean origin of the higher Pselaphinae as a whole. Here, I describe fossils from mid-Cretaceous (approximate to 99 million years old) Burmese amber that confirm the existence of crown-group higher pselaphines on the Eurasian supercontinent prior to contact with Gondwanan landmasses. Protrichonyx rafifronsgen. et sp.n. is placed incertae sedis within the higher Pselaphinae. Boreotethysgen.n., erected for B. grimaldiisp.n. and B. arctopteryxsp.n., represents an extinct sister taxon and putative stem group of Bythinini, a Recent tribe with a primarily Holarctic distribution. The Laurasian palaeolocality of the newly described taxa implies that higher pselaphines are indeed probably of Jurassic, Pangaean extraction and that the Laurasian-Gondwanan tribal dichotomy of this clade may have developed vicariantly following Pangaean rifting. Higher pselaphines probably predate the earliest ants. Their physically protective morphological ground plan may have been a preadaptation for myrmecophily when ants became diverse and ecologically ubiquitous, much later in the Cenozoic.

They have a fossil history extending to the Early Jurassic. During the past 180 Myr, the lineage has undergone significant evolutionary transformation, exhibiting an elevated diversity in morphology yet retaining the same overall ground plan. Although raptorial foreleg morphology and capture behaviour are well documented in extant insects, they are poorly known for premodern lineages, attributable to the scarcity and poor preservation of fossils. Here, we report two new genera and species of Mantispidae from mid-Cretaceous Myanmar (Burmese) amber. Both taxa have highly specialized raptorial forelegs and highlight modification of capture strategy in Cretaceous Mantispidae. The foreleg of both species has one major spine that is the same length as the foretibia on the ventral surface of the forefemur, which faces the foretibia with a row of robust setae. The two new amber mantid lacewings provide structural and functional indications that represent an extinct mode of capture strategy. The new findings reveal the presence of a geochronologically rapid diversification of Mantispidae during the Early Cretaceous, thereby illuminating the varied morphologies involved in prey-capture strategies integral to the early evolution of mantispids.","[Shi, Chaofan] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Earth Sci & Engn, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Geodynam & Geohazards, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Mineral Resources & Geol P, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China; [Yang, Qiang] Guangzhou Univ, Sch Life Sci, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China; [Shih, Chungkun; Labandeira, Conrad C.; Ren, Dong] Capital Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China; [Shih, Chungkun; Labandeira, Conrad C.; Ren, Dong] Capital Normal Univ, Acad Multidisciplinary Studies, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China; [Shih, Chungkun; Labandeira, Conrad C.] Smithsonian Inst, Dept Paleobiol, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Washington, DC 20013 USA; [Labandeira, Conrad C.] Univ Maryland, Dept Entomol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Pang, Hong] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Ecol, Museum Biol, Key Lab Biodivers Dynam & Conservat,Guangdong Hig, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China","Shi, CF (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Earth Sci & Engn, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Geodynam & Geohazards, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Mineral Resources & Geol P, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China.; Yang, Q (corresponding author), Guangzhou Univ, Sch Life Sci, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China.",shichf5@mail.sysu.edu.cn; yq11_1984@126.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31501881, 31711530649, 41602014, 41688103]; Basal Research Fund of Sun Yat-sen University [17lgzd04]; Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in UniversityProgram for Changjiang Scholars & Innovative Research Team in University (PCSIRT) [IRT-17R75]; Support Project of High-level Teachers in Beijing Municipal Universities [IDHT20180518]; China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2016M592570]; Scientific Research Foundation of Guangzhou University [2900603133]; Basic Work Special Project of the National Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2013FY111500]","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant nos. 31501881, 31711530649,41602014,41688103),BasalResearch Fund of Sun Yat-sen University (grant no. 17lgzd04), Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University (grant no.

Despite their diversity and ecological impact, little is known about the early evolution and ecology of parasitoid insects, especially parasitoid true flies (Diptera). Here, we describe a bizarre fly, Zhenia xiai gen. et sp. nov., from Late Cretaceous Burmese amber (about 99 million years old) that represents the latest occurrence of the family Eremochaetidae. Z. xiai is an endoparasitoid insect as evidenced by a highly developed, hypodermic-like ovipositor formed by abdominal tergites VIII + IX that was used for injecting eggs into hosts and enlarged tridactylous claws supposedly for clasping hosts. Our results suggest that eremochaetids are among the earliest definite records of parasitoid insects. Our findings reveal an unexpected morphological specialization of flies and broaden our understanding of the evolution and diversity of ancient parasitoid insects.","[Zhang, Qingqing; Zhang, Junfeng; Zhang, Haichun; Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qingqing] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Junfeng] Shenyang Normal Univ, Coll Palaeontol, Shenyang 110034, Peoples R China; [Feng, Yitao] Nanjiao Bieshu 394, Shanghai 201108, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Wang, B (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China.; Wang, B (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",bowang@nigpas.ac.cn,,,"National Basic Research Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2012CB821900]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41572010, J1210006]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of CAS [2011224]","We are grateful to Prof. E.A.

(Hymenoptera: Dryinidae), is described from Burmese amber. Raptodryininae subfam. nov. represents one of the first fossil groups of chelate dryinids, documenting the fact that the evolution of chela still took place at the earliest Late Cretaceous. It is characterized by a very peculiar chela, composed of a proximal lobe of the fifth protarsomere opposable on a complex composed of the fifth protarsomere + arolium + both claws. This type of chela differs completely from the common chelae of extant and known fossil pincer wasps (composed of one enlarged claw opposable on a more or less strongly projecting fifth protarsomere). The chela of R. patrickmuelleri represents probably an early evolutionary stage of pincer wasps close to the basal Dryinidae, whose females were achelate. This discovery enabled us to outline the evolution of the chela of Dryinidae. In the evolution of pincer wasps, the oldest known fossil species, Aphelopus palaeophoenicius Olmi 2000, from Barremian Lebanese amber is of special importance as a basal exemplar. We had re-examined this species and attributed it to a new genus, Archaeodryinus gen. nov., and a new subfamily, Archaeodryininae subfam. nov., documenting the first known basal achelate pincer wasp. The emended data on the subfamily Aphelopinae suggest that this taxon is known only since the Miocene and that its females had secondarily lost their chelae. The discussion on biological features of Aphelopus that enabled parasitism on Typhlocybinae (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) is also given. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

A dataset of 43 ingroup taxa and four outgroup taxa based on 110 morphological characters was analysed under parsimony.

This discovery also confirms the still higher diversity of Gomphaeschnidae during the Paleogene compared to the Neogene that was dominated by the more derived Aeshnidae sensu stricto.","[Pinkert, Stefan] Philipps Univ Marburg, Fac Biol, Dept Ecol Anim Ecol, Karl Von Frisch Str 8, D-35043 Marburg, Germany; [Bechly, Guenter] Am Stadtgarten 4, D-71032 Boblingen, Germany; [Nel, Andre] UPMC, Sorbonne Univ, CNRS,Museum Natl Hist Nat, Inst Systemat Evolut BIodivers ISYEB,MNHN,EPHE, 57 Rue Cuvier,CP 50,Entomol, F-75005 Paris, France","Bechly, G (corresponding author), Am Stadtgarten 4, D-71032 Boblingen, Germany.; Nel, A (corresponding author), UPMC, Sorbonne Univ, CNRS,Museum Natl Hist Nat, Inst Systemat Evolut BIodivers ISYEB,MNHN,EPHE, 57 Rue Cuvier,CP 50,Entomol, F-75005 Paris, France.",StefanPinkert@posteo.de; bechly@mac.com; anel@mnhn.fr,"Bechly, Gunter/M-6302-2017; Pinkert, Stefan/J-3602-2019","Bechly, Gunter/0000-0002-9162-4294; Pinkert, Stefan/0000-0002-8348-2337",,,,26,3,4,0,9,MAGNOLIA PRESS,AUCKLAND,"PO BOX 41383, AUCKLAND, ST LUKES 1030, NEW ZEALAND",1175-5326,1175-5334,,ZOOTAXA,Zootaxa,MAY 29,2017,4272,2,,,,,263,275,,10.11646/zootaxa.4272.2.7,,,13,Zoology,Zoology,EW0MK,WOS:000402185000007,28610295,,,,2021-07-18

Phylogenetic relationships within the Cyclophoroidea were previously studied using extant species, but timing of divergence within the group remains unclear. In addition, it is difficult to observe morphological traits such as the chitinous operculum and periostracum of fossil snails due to their poor preservation potential. Here we describe nine species including a new genus and five new species of well-preserved fossil cyclophoroideans from the mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber. These fossils include not only the shell, but also the chitinous operculum and periostracum, soft body, and excrements.

(Diptera, Chironomidae, Podonominae) is described from mid-Cretaceous amber of northern Myanmar (similar to 100 Ma). The adult male of the new species/genus displays an interesting wing structure with a trace of the vein R2+3 (or R-3 alone), the character unique in the subfamily Podonominae. The wing squama with a process bearing a bunch of setae, the wing membrane covered with bi- or trifid spinulae-like microtrichia, the gonostylus with a collar-like ring and a pear-shaped distal part, the robust anal point and the extensive superior volsella are also characters defined as exclusive for Burmochlus. The antenna, thorax and several hypopygium structures found in male Burmochlus clearly resemble those known from Archaeochlus Brundin, here defined as the closest relative, as well as from Afrochlus Freeman and Austrochlus Cranston - both previously referenced to or derived from Archaeochlus, hence being postulated as close or sister taxa. In a view of several hypotheses on the time of divergence of the Podonominae and other related subfamilies, this is the oldest fossil record of a true Podonominae chironomid based on definition of male characters, and dated back to the mid-Cretaceous. Along with Furcobuchonomyia Baranov, Goral et Ross (Buchonomyiinae) and Myanmaro Gitka, Makarchenko, Pankowski et Zakrzewska (Orthocladiinae), Burmochlus is the third genus described from Burmese amber, and the first known Podonominae chironomid described from this deposit.

Previous work suggested it was most closely related to the modern and widespread European sheep tick Ixodes ricinus (Linneaus, 1758). Results: Restudy using phase contrast synchrotron x-ray tomography yielded images of exceptional quality. These confirm the fossil's referral to Ixodes Latreille, 1795, but the characters resolved here suggest instead affinities with the Asian subgenus Partipalpiger Hoogstraal et al., 1973 and its single living (and medically significant) species Ixodes ovatus Neumann, 1899. We redescribe the amber fossil here as Ixodes (Partipalpiger) succineus. Conclusions: Our data suggest that Ixodes ricinus is unlikely to be directly derived from Weidner's amber species, but instead reveals that the Partipalpiger lineage was originally more widely distributed across the northern hemisphere. The closeness of Ixodes (P.) succineus to a living vector of a wide range of pathogens offers the potential to correlate its spatial and temporal position (northern Europe, nearly 50 million years ago) with the estimated origination dates of various tick-borne diseases.","[Dunlop, Jason A.] Leibniz Inst Res Evolut & Biodivers, Museum Nat Kunde, Invalidenstr 43, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Apanaskevich, Dmitry A.] Georgia Southern Univ, James H Oliver Jr Inst Coastal Plain Sci, US Natl Tick Collect, Statesboro, GA 30460 USA; [Lehmann, Jens] Univ Bremen, Fac Geosci, D-28357 Bremen, Germany; [Hoffmann, Rene] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Geol Mineral & Geophys, Dept Earth Sci, D-44801 Bochum, Germany; [Fusseis, Florian] Univ Edinburgh, Grant Inst, Sch Geosci, Kings Bldg,West Mains Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3JW, Midlothian, Scotland; [Ehlke, Moritz; Zachow, Stefan] Zuse Inst Berlin, Dept Visualizat & Data Anal, Med Planning Grp, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Xiao, Xianghui] Argonne Natl Lab, Adv Photon Source, 9700 S Cass Ave, Lemont, IL 60439 USA","Dunlop, JA (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Res Evolut & Biodivers, Museum Nat Kunde, Invalidenstr 43, D-10115 Berlin, Germany.",jason.dunlop@mfn-berlin.de,"Dunlop, Jason A./AAC-8042-2019; Lehmann, Jens/A-6516-2009; Fusseis, Florian/M-5321-2016","Fusseis, Florian/0000-0002-3104-8109; Lehmann, Jens/0000-0001-6580-6644",U.S. Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC02-06CH11357]; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious DiseasesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R15AI096317]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R15AI096317] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"We appreciate technical support by M.

These included two Cretaceous ambers (from Myanmar [Burma] and central New Jersey), two Tertiary ambers (from the Baltic and the Dominican Republic), and Holocene copal from Zanzibar. The five resins were chosen for their disparate ages and botanical origins (and thus chemical and physical properties), as well as their paleontological significance. In all cases, pronounced deterioration occurred under combined exposure to light and fluctuating humidity, based on surface crazing and a decrease in absorbance of light in the UV region (360-400 nm). While crazing did not visibly occur in cases of fluctuating humidity in dark conditions, or UV exposure alone, spectrophotometric evidence indicates that some deterioration did take place. Yellowing after exposure to elevated temperatures occurred in all samples tested, with the exception of Burmese amber. All four true ambers exhibited a decrease in UV absorbance after exposure to heat (while copal actually showed an increase). The samples from the five deposits represent three chemical subclasses of fossil resins, and each of the resins reacted differently to the various aging conditions, with New Jersey amber particularly unstable. Based on these results, amber collections should be stored in an environment with stable humidity, relatively low heat, and minimal exposure to light. Anoxic sealing and storage, and particularly embedding amber samples in a high-grade epoxy, may be beneficial, and further investigation is indicated.","[Bisulca, Christina] Univ Arizona, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Arizona State Museum, Tucson, AZ 85712 USA; [Nascimbene, Paul C.; Grimaldi, David A.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Elkin, Lisa] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Off Registrar & Nat Sci Collect Conservat, New York, NY 10024 USA","Bisulca, C (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Arizona State Museum, Tucson, AZ 85712 USA.",,,,"Natural Science Collections Conservation Grant; Board of Trustees, AMNH","The authors wish to thank reviewers Enrique Penalver and Janet Waddington for their comprehensive input and commentary, by which the paper was significantly improved.

Variants in melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) causes common coat colour phenotypes in a variety of mammalian species but only limited colour variation in the domestic cat. Known as the extension (E) locus, melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) interacts with the agouti locus to produce the eumelanin and pheomelanin pigments. Recently, a novel reddish coloration, which is termed russet, was identified in the Burmese cat breed. Because this russet Burmese coloration changes with aging, MC1R was suggested as candidate gene. The similar colouration in specific lineages of Norwegian Forest cat known as amber (e) (c. 250G>A; p. Asp84Asn) was excluded for this Burmese phenotype. The complete 954-bp coding region of MC1R was directly sequenced in russet Burmese and suspected carriers. A 3-bp deletion (c.439_441del) associated with the deletion of a phenyalanine (p. Phe146del) in the protein sequence was identified. All russet coloured cats were homozygous for the variant, and all obligate carriers were heterozygous, confirming that the deletion segregated concordantly with colouring in Burmese cats from the New Zealand foundation lineage. The variant was not identified in 442 cats from 26 different breeds and random-bred cats. Twenty-six Burmese from the USA did not have the variant. This MC1R variant defines a unique coloration and the second breed-specific MC1R variant in cats. The interactions of the two recessive feline MC1R alleles (E > e, e(r)) is unknown.","[Gustafson, N.

Fossil records of this large tribe are rare, and are mostly confined to Eocene to Miocene amber, whereas only four genera were known from Mesozoic deposits. Here we report a new Mesozoic taxon, Pangusyndicus excavatus Yin, Zhou & Cai gen. et sp. nov., from Cenomanian Burmese amber. For the first time the ventral cephalic structures of an extinct Glandulariini are observable, a character system usually difficult to discern, especially in fossil scydmaenines. Pangusyndicus clearly lacks lateral sulci on the submentum, a critical character state that justifies the placement of Pangusyndicus in one of the two assumedly natural groups' of Glandulariini. Pangusyndicus displays strongly reduced antennomeres XI, similar to those found only in the extant Australo-Oriental genus Syndicus Motschulsky. To test the phylogenetic position of Pangusyndicus, cladistic analyses were performed based on morphological data. Both parsimonious and maximum likelihood cladograms recovered a close relationship between Pangusyndicus, Syndicus and Loeblites Franz, indicating the unique reduction of apical antennomeres in this group may have originated once, and by the mid-Cretaceous at the latest. More strikingly, Pangusyndicus possesses a large cavity on the mediobasal surface of the pronotal disc, a feature previously unknown among all scydmaenines. We interpret this as a specialized glandular structure, although its function remains uncertain. The presence of such a cavity in Pangusyndicus represents the earliest known presumably glandular structure in Staphylinidae. Moreover, Pangusyndicus and several recently described mid-Cretaceous scydmaenines belonging to various tribes exhibit notably longer legs than their extant relatives, indicating shifts in habitat and prey preferences may have occurred during the evolution of these groups.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:11529A5C-DAF3-4AD9-A074-10E937CE75C","[Yin, Ziwei; Zhou, Deyao] Shanghai Normal Univ, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Dept Biol, Shanghai 200234, Peoples R China; [Cai, Chenyang] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, Key Lab Econ Stratig & Palaeogeog, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Cai, Chenyang] Univ Bristol, Sch Earth Sci, Bristol BS8 1TQ, Avon, England; [Huang, Diying] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Cai, Chenyang; Huang, Diying] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Engel, Michael S.] Univ Kansas, Div Entomol, Nat Hist Museum, 1501 Crestline Dr,Suite 140, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Engel, Michael S.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 1501 Crestline Dr,Suite 140, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Engel, Michael S.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, Cent Pk West 79th St, New York, NY 10024 USA","Cai, CY (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, Key Lab Econ Stratig & Palaeogeog, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Cai, CY (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Sch Earth Sci, Bristol BS8 1TQ, Avon, England.; Cai, CY (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",cycai@nigpas.ac.cn,"Engel, Michael S/C-5461-2012","Engel, Michael S/0000-0003-3067-077X","Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB26000000]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41602009, 41688103]; US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1144162]","We thank Pawel Jaoszyski (Wrocaw, Poland) for providing comments on an early draft of the manuscript.

Fungus-feeding, or mycophagy, is remarkably widespread in beetles (Coleoptera) and appears to be a primitive feeding habit that preceded feeding on plant tissues. Numerous Mesozoic beetles belonging to extant fungus-associated families are known, but direct fossil evidence elucidating mycophagy in insects has remained elusive. Here, we report a remarkable genus and species, Vetuproteinus cretaceus gen. et sp. nov., belonging to a newtribe (Vetuproteinini trib. nov.) of the extant rove beetle subfamily Proteininae (Staphylinidae) in Mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber. The mouthparts of this beetle have a markedly enlarged protruding galea bearing an apparent spore brush, a specialized structure we infer was used to scrape spores off surfaces and direct them into the mouth, as in multiple modern spore-feeding beetles. Considering the long evolutionary history of Fungi, the Mid-Cretaceous beetles likely fed on ancient Basidiomycota and/or Ascomycota fungi or spore-producing organisms such as slime moulds (Myxomycetes). The discovery of the first Mesozoic proteinine illustrates the antiquity of the subfamily, and suggests that ancestral Proteininae were already diverse and widespread in Pangaea before the supercontinent broke up.","[Cai, Chenyang] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, Key Lab Econ Stratig & Palaeogeog, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Cai, Chenyang; Huang, Diying] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Newton, Alfred F.; Thayer, Margaret K.] Field Museum Nat Hist, Integrat Res Ctr, 1400 S Lake Shore Dr, Chicago, IL 60605 USA; [Leschen, Richard A.

Two specimens consisting of partial hindlimbs exhibit unusual morphologies when compared to both extant avian taxa and other Cretaceous enantiornithines. Pedal morphology is extremely ecologically informative in Aves as it represents the interface between body and substrate. These seemingly bizarre pedal morphologies represent adaptations that allowed these birds to utilize certain niches present in their paleoenvironment. Specific ecological niches apply the same general pressures to different species over time, and in doing so, through natural selection, produce morphologies that function much the same, although they may be anatomically dissimilar. As such, extant animals can provide useful information pertaining to the functional morphology of extinct animals, even in the absence of direct analogs, as in the case of these two Hukawng enantiornithines. Comparisons to extant taxa in the same predicted niches of these enantiornithines can be used to either support or contradict previous hypotheses regarding the in vivo function of these unique pedal morphologies. Elektorornis chenguangi exhibits a hypertrophied third pedal digit, originally interpreted as an appendage used for probing. We support this interpretation, which allows informed speculation as to the cranial anatomy of this taxon since extant animals that probe in woody substrates consistently pair elongate probing structures with a second robust structure that functions as a means to penetrate into this hard substrate. This suggests that the rostrum of Elektorornis would have been robust and most likely edentulous. The second specimen YLSNHM01001 exhibits an unusually mediolaterally robust fourth pedal digit, nearly double the width of digit II. Given that no such morphology is present in any other bird in the Mesozoic or Cenozoic we feel the unusual morphology justifies erection of a new taxon, Fortipesavis prehendens gen. et sp. nov. Although distinct, the morphology in F. prehendens resembles the syndactyl condition in some extant avian groups, and we hypothesize the robust digit similarly functioned to increase the surface area of the foot, facilitating grip on perches through increased friction. The necessity for increased grip and the lateral placement of this digit may suggest F. prehendens utilized mobile perches similar to extant kingfishers.","[Clark, Alexander D.] West Virginia Univ, Davis Coll Agr, Nat Resources & Design, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA; [O'Connor, Jingmai K.] Field Museum Nat Hist, Chicago, IL 60605 USA","Clark, AD (corresponding author), West Virginia Univ, Davis Coll Agr, Nat Resources & Design, Morgantown, WV 26506 USA.",ac00040@mix.wvu.edu,,,,,,101,0,0,0,0,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",2296-701X,,,FRONT ECOL EVOL,Front.

Quite on the contrary, the fossil record of caterpillars is quite scarce, with four occurrences in Cretaceous ambers representing the oldest ones. Here we report a new specimen from 100 million-year-old Cretaceous Myanmar amber. The caterpillar has appendages on abdomen segments 3-6 and 10. Such an arrangement is today only known in caterpillars of the group Gracillariidae. These caterpillars are usually dorso-ventrally flattened, adapted for leaf mining. The fossil specimen does not appear flattened and is additionally armoured with spines dorsally on the trunk segments. All other known Cretaceous larvae are naked, lacking dorsal armature. The new specimen hence increases the diversity of Cretaceous caterpillars. This finding is congruent with recent phylogenetic reconstructions and hence supports an early diversification of the group Lepidoptera. (c) 2021 International Association for Gondwana Research.

The patella is regarded as an example of functional morphology and probably served in the capacity of catching and/or holding down prey, probably mites, since all extant members of this family are mite predators. This character appears to have been specific to this clade of antlike stone beetles, since no other members (extinct or extant) of the family have a patella. Another unusual character of H. burmitis is the extended abdomen and elongate strongly sclerotized ovipositor, thus allowing eggs to be inserted into cracks or soft tissue.

While adult mantis lacewings are hence active wait-and-catch predators, the larvae of many mantis lacewings have a quite different biology: first-stage larvae seek out female spiders, mount them, and either wait until the spider has produced an egg sac or, in some cases, choose a female already bearing an egg sac. The larva then enters the egg sac and feeds on the eggs. While first stage larvae are highly mobile with comparably long legs and a certain degree of dorso-ventral flattening (campodeiform), larval stages two and three are almost immobile, grub-like, and simply remain within the egg sac. Fossils of mantis lacewings are relatively rare, fossils of larval mantis lacewings are even rarer; only a single larva sitting on a juvenile spider has been described from ca. 50 million year old Baltic amber.ResultsHere we describe a second occurrence of a larval mantis lacewing from significantly older Burmese amber, about 100 million years old. The specimen is preserved in a position right at the leg of a spider, similar to modern-day larvae that are about to mount their prospective host. The claws of the larva can be seen to grab around the leg of the spider.ConclusionsWe discuss how reliable these fossils are as indicators of palaeo-parasitism, and in which aspects the behaviour of mantis lacewing larvae in general indeed represents parasitism. While the specimen appears to be about to board the spider, it may not necessarily represent a parasite in the strict sense. Evaluating the actual ecological role of a fossil heavily depends on comparison to modern forms, and not all modern-day larvae of Mantispidae are parasites. We therefore provide a closer look into the known feeding habits of modern mantis lacewing larvae.","[Haug, Joachim T.; Haug, Carolin] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Bioctr, Grosshaderner Str 2, Planegg Martinsried, Germany; [Haug, Joachim T.; Haug, Carolin] LMU, GeoBio Ctr, Richard Wagner Str 10, D-80333 Munich, Germany","Haug, JT (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Bioctr, Grosshaderner Str 2, Planegg Martinsried, Germany.; Haug, JT (corresponding author), LMU, GeoBio Ctr, Richard Wagner Str 10, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",joachim.haug@palaeo-evo-devo.info,,,Volkswagen FoundationVolkswagen,The Volkswagen Foundation supports JTH with a Lichtenberg professorship.,,26,20,23,0,4,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2056-306X,,,ZOOL LETT,Zool.

Morphological characters used in the identification of fossil genera and species are identical to those used in studies of extant Ceratopogonidae and, as a result, their potential indicative value is reliable. Two relictual extant genera, Leptoconops and Austroconops, reported from Lower Cretaceous Lebanese amber, are at least 125 million years old. Certain ceratopogonid genera are indicative for the Lower Cretaceous, Upper Cretaceous, Eocene or Miocene. A morphological character indicative for the Upper Cretaceous and Cenozoic is macrotrichia on the wing membrane of adults. Indicator species and genera are reviewed for all amber deposits. Eocene Baltic amber contains the best known fauna of biting midges, with 109 named species. Some genera are indicative of aquatic and semiaquatic habitats (predaceous genera, subfamily Ceratopogoninae), forests with rotting trees (Forcipomyia), sandy sea shore habitats (Leptoconops), a cold boreal climate (Ceratopogon) or warm climates (Nannohelea, Austroconops, Leptoconops, Meunierohelea, Metahelea). Females require a protein-rich meal and are well known for feeding on the blood of vertebrates, but many feed on other things, so this information can help with the interpretation of palaeoenvironments.

One large aggregation, comprising 8 soldiers, 56 workers/pseudergates and 25 immatures of different instars, additionally presents the behaviours of cooperative brood care and overlapping generations.

On the basis of new fossil data and phylogenetic analyses, this froghopper family is herein chosen as a case study to discuss the potential influence of the absence and/or neglect of body information in palaeoentomological studies. Mesodorus orientalis Chen et Wang, gen. et sp. nov., found in the mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber, bears a venational topology of fore- and hindwings similar to that of the genus Fangyuania from the same horizon and locality, but distinctly differs from the latter and other known sinoalids in possessing a series of unique body characters. Given the similar wing features, Jiania crebra and J. gracila were proposed to be synonyms in a recent study; these two congeners, however, are apparently discernable in their ovipositor and so the synonym should be rejected. Three main clades were recovered within the Sinoalidae in our cladistic analyses, including Clade I (Stictocercopis + Chengdecercopis), Clade II (Huabeicercopis + Luanpingia + Sinoala + Jiania + Shufania), and Clade III (Fangyuania + Mesodorus), and their relationship is as following: Clade I + (Clade II+Clade III). The Jurassic Clade I, as the basal lineage, is remarkably different from other sinoalids in bearing wings with complex venation, but similar to the Jurassic Clade II in body structures. The Cretaceous Clade III possesses a reduced wing topology similar to Clade II, but differs from the latter in possessing a series of novel body characteristics for each taxon (i.e., Fangyuania and Mesodorus). Unsurprisingly, our finds confirm that the information from body structures, vital to understanding the biodiversity and evolutionary history of extinct insects, should not be ignored in palaeoentomological studies.","[Chen, Jun; Zheng, Yan; Zhang, Junqiang; An, Baizheng] Linyi Univ, Inst Geol & Paleontol, Shuangling Rd, Linyi 276000, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Chen, Jun; Wang, Bo; Zheng, Yan; Jiang, Hui; Zhang, Haichun] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Chen, Jun; Wang, Bo; Zheng, Yan; Jiang, Hui; Zhang, Haichun] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, 1 Beichen West Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Hui] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Tian] China Univ Geosci, State Key Lab Biogeol & Environm Geol, Xueyuan Lu 29, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China","Chen, J (corresponding author), Linyi Univ, Inst Geol & Paleontol, Shuangling Rd, Linyi 276000, Shandong, Peoples R China.; Chen, J; Zhang, HC (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",rubiscada@sina.com; hczhang@nigpas.ac.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41502007, 41702012, 41572010, 41622201, 41688103]; Natural Scientific Foundation of Shandong ProvinceNatural Science Foundation of Shandong Province [ZR2016DB24, ZR2016DL04]; China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2017M621582]; State Key Laboratory of Palaeobiology and Stratigraphy (Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, CAS)Chinese Academy of Sciences [183105]; Strategic Priority Research Program (B) of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB26000000]","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41502007; 41702012; 41572010; 41622201; 41688103), the Natural Scientific Foundation of Shandong Province (ZR2016DB24; ZR2016DL04), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2017M621582), the State Key Laboratory of Palaeobiology and Stratigraphy (Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, CAS) (No. 183105), and the Strategic Priority Research Program (B) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDB26000000).",,63,13,14,0,6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1439-6092,1618-1077,,ORG DIVERS EVOL,Org.

Described taxa vary considerably with regard to total size, head and body proportion, cuticular sculpturing, and petiole structure while all species are unified by a distinct shared character. The assemblage represents the largest known diversification of closely related Cretaceous ants with respect to species number. These stem-group ants exhibit some characteristics previously known only from their extant counterparts along with presumed plesiomorphic morphology. Consequently, their morphology may inform hypotheses relating to basal relationships and general patterns of ant evolution. These and other uncovered Cretaceous species indicate that stem-group ants are not simply wasp-like, transitional formicids, but rather a group of considerable adaptive diversity, exhibiting innovations analogous to what crown-group ants would echo 100 million years later.","[Barden, Phillip; Grimaldi, David] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Barden, Phillip] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Richard Gilder Grad Sch, New York, NY 10024 USA","Barden, P (corresponding author), Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, New York, NY 10024 USA.",pbarden@amnh.org,,"Barden, Phillip/0000-0001-6277-320X",Richard Gilder Graduate School at the American Museum of Natural History; National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship ProgramNational Science Foundation (NSF),"Financial support was provided by the Richard Gilder Graduate School at the American Museum of Natural History and National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program.

Larvae live primarily in decaying vegetation, feeding on fungal mycelia, and they can be among the most abundant insects of temperate forests. Stem-group families appeared in the Jurassic, with large Tertiary deposits being composed almost entirely of living genera, so the Cretaceous is essential for understanding the origins and diversification of Recent families. Sixty-six specimens were studied from six major deposits of Cretaceous amber, spanning 40 million years from the Early to Late Cretaceous: Lebanon (ca. 125 Ma), northern Spain (120 Ma), northern Myanmar (Burma) (ca. 105 Ma), northern Siberia (two sites, 105 and 87 Ma), New Jersey (90 Ma), and western Canada (80 Ma).

Representatives of Epicaridea (ingroup of Cymothoida) are parasitic on crustaceans and usually go through three distinct larval stages. The fossil record of Epicaridea is sparse and thus little is known about the palaeoecology and the origin of the complex life cycle of modern epicarideans. We present an assemblage of over 100 epicarideans preserved in a single piece of Late Cretaceous Myanmar amber. All individuals are morphologically similar to cryptoniscium stage larvae. The cryptoniscium stage usually constitutes the third and last larval stage. In modern representatives of Epicaridea, the cryptoniscium larvae are planktic and search for suitable host animals or adult females. These fossil specimens, though similar to some extant species, differ from other fossil epicaridean larvae in many aspects. Thus, a new species (and a new genus), Cryptolacruma nidis, is erected. Several factors can favour the preservation of multiple conspecific animals in a single piece of amber. However, the enormous density of epicarideans in the herein presented amber piece can only be explained by circumstances that result in high local densities of individuals, close to the resin-producing tree.","[Schaedel, Mario; Haug, Joachim T.] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Fac Biol, Grosshaderner Str 2, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany; [Hoernig, Marie K.] Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Museum & Inst Zool, Cytol & Evolutionary Biol, Soldmannstr 23, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany; [Hyzny, Matus] Comenius Univ, Dept Geol & Paleontol, Ilkovicova 6, Bratislava 84215, Slovakia; [Haug, Joachim T.] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, GeoBio Ctr, Richard Wagner Str 10, D-80333 Munich, Germany","Schadel, M (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Fac Biol, Grosshaderner Str 2, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany.",mario.schaedel@palaeo-evo-devo.info; marie.hoernig@palaeo-evo-devo.info; matus.hyzny@uniba.sk; joachim.haug@palaeo-evo-devo.info,,,"Slovak Research and Development AgencySlovak Research and Development Agency [APVV-0436-12, /0042/18]; UNESCO-Amba/ MVTS of Presidium of the Slovak Academy of Sciences; Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [DFG 6300/3-2]; Volkswagen FoundationVolkswagen; Lichtenberg professorship; Deutsche ForschungsgesellschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [Xradia XCT-200, DFG INST 292/119-1 FUGG, DFG INST 292/120-1 FUGG]","We thank Peter Vransky (ESISAS, ZISAS, FISAS Bratislava) for revealing the sample from his personal collection.

Incomplete knowledge of early feathers prevents a full understanding of how cylindrical rachises have evolved. Bizarre feathers with unusually wide and flattened rachises, known as rachis-dominated feathers (RDFs), have been observed in fossil nonavian and avian theropods. Newly discovered RDFs embedded in early Late Cretaceous Burmese ambers (about 99 million year ago) suggest the unusually wide and flattened rachises mainly consist of a dorsal cortex, lacking a medulla and a ventral cortex. Coupled with findings on extant feather morphogenesis, known fossil RDFs were categorized into three morphotypes based on their rachidial configurations. For each morphotype, potential developmental scenarios were depicted by referring to the rachidial development in chickens, and relative stiffness of each morphotype was estimated through functional simulations. The results suggest rachises of RDFs are developmentally equivalent to a variety of immature stages of cylindrical rachises. Similar rachidial morphotypes documented in extant penguins suggest that the RDFs are not unique to Mesozoic theropods, although they are likely to have evolved independently in extant penguins.","[Wang, Shuo; Hans, Harn I-Chen; Wu, Ping; Habib, Michael; Chuong, Cheng-Ming] Univ Southern Calif, Keck Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Los Angeles, CA 90033 USA; [Chang, Wei-Ling] China Med Univ Hosp, Integrat Stem Cell Ctr, Taichung 40447, Taiwan; [Zhang, Qiyue; Juan, Wen-Tau] Nankai Univ, Coll Life Sci, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China; [Ma, Menglu; Yang, Rui] Capital Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Lab Vertebrate Evolut, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China; [Yang, Feng] Capital Normal Univ, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Imaging Technol, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China; [Zhuo, De] Beijing Xiachong Amber Museum, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Hans, Harn I-Chen] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Int Res Ctr Wound Repair & Regenerat, Tainan 70101, Taiwan; [Habib, Michael] Los Angeles Cty Museum Nat Hist, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA; [Juan, Wen-Tau] China Med Univ, Dept Biomed Imaging & Radiol Sci, Taichung 40402, Taiwan","Wang, S (corresponding author), Univ Southern Calif, Keck Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Los Angeles, CA 90033 USA.",dinoshuo@gmail.com; cmchuong@med.usc.edu,"Wang, Shuo/AAX-8516-2020","Wang, Shuo/0000-0002-4076-0202","Human Frontier Sciences ProjectHuman Frontier Science Program [LT000728/2018]; National Institutes of Health, USAUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [AR47364, AR60306]; China Medical University (CMU)/ Hospital in Taiwan [5351285884]; USC [5351285884]; Integrative Stem Cell Center, CMU/ Hospital in Taiwan; Taiwan Higher Education Sprout Project by the Ministry of Education in Taiwan; Ministry of Science and Technology in TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","We wish to thank the editors and two anonymous reviews for their constrictive critiques and advices improving the manuscript.

Cretaceous amber is also relatively abundant, yet it is seldom found in direct stratigraphic association with dinosaur remains. Here we describe an unusually large amber specimen attached to a Prosaurolophus jaw, which reveals details of the contemporaneous paleoforest and entomofauna. Fourier-transform Infrared spectroscopy and stable isotope composition (H and C) suggest the amber formed from resins exuded by cupressaceous conifers occupying a coastal plain. An aphid within the amber belongs to Cretamyzidae, a Cretaceous family suggested to bark-feed on conifers. Distinct tooth row impressions on the amber match the hadrosaur's alveolar bone ridges, providing some insight into the taphonomic processes that brought these remains together.","[McKellar, Ryan C.; Cockx, Pierre] Royal Saskatchewan Museum, Dept Palaeontol, 2340 Albert St, Regina, SK S4P 2V7, Canada; [McKellar, Ryan C.; Engel, Michael S.] Univ Kansas, Div Entomol, Nat Hist Museum, 1501 Crestline Dr Suite 140, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [McKellar, Ryan C.; Engel, Michael S.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 1501 Crestline Dr Suite 140, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [McKellar, Ryan C.; Cockx, Pierre] Univ Regina, Biol Dept, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada; [Jones, Emma; Muehlenbachs, Karlis] Univ Alberta, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E3, Canada; [Tappert, Ralf] Lakehead Univ, Geol Dept, Thunder Bay, ON P7B 5E1, Canada; [Wolfe, Alexander P.; Koppelhus, Eva B.; Currie, Philip J.] Univ Alberta, Dept Biol Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E9, Canada","McKellar, RC (corresponding author), Royal Saskatchewan Museum, Dept Palaeontol, 2340 Albert St, Regina, SK S4P 2V7, Canada.; McKellar, RC (corresponding author), Univ Kansas, Div Entomol, Nat Hist Museum, 1501 Crestline Dr Suite 140, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.; McKellar, RC (corresponding author), Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 1501 Crestline Dr Suite 140, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.; McKellar, RC (corresponding author), Univ Regina, Biol Dept, Regina, SK S4S 0A2, Canada.",ryan.mckellar@gov.sk.ca,"Engel, Michael S/C-5461-2012","Engel, Michael S/0000-0003-3067-077X; Cockx, Pierre/0000-0002-9624-6878","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of CanadaNatural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)CGIAR [2017-04715, 2015-0061]; Dinosaur Research Institute; Mitacs Accelerate Internship; Friends of the RSM","We thank C.

The possible assignment to Teredolites or Gastrochaenolites is discussed considering the type of substrate as an ichnotaxobase. It is proposed to regard amber or similar resins as a variant of xylic substrates and to maintain the separation between the two ichnogenera and their different paleoecological implications. The amber borings are assigned to Teredolites clavatus Leymerie, 1842 and Apectoichnus longissimus (Kelly and Bromley, 1984), respectively. The presence of bioglyphs in a few borings suggests a mechanical production process, with pholadid bivalves such as Martesia preserved inside many of the samples representing the producer. In general, the amber-producing trees mostly grew along a forested coastline, where they were occasionally flooded by seawater or even transported from rivers into the sea and later deposited.","[Mayoral, Eduardo] Univ Huelva, Fac Expt Sci, Dept Earth Sci, Campus El Carmen,Avda 3 Marzo S-N, Huelva 21071, Spain; [Mayoral, Eduardo; Santos, Ana] Univ Huelva, CCTH Sci & Technol Res Ctr, Dept Apply Geosci, Av Fuerzas Armadas SN, Huelva 21071, Spain; [Vintaned, J.

Proteins ranging in age from the Quaternary to Jurassic are being used to answer questions about phylogeny, evolution, and extinction. However, these analyses are sometimes contentious, and focus primarily on large vertebrates in sedimentary fossilisation environments; there are few studies of protein preservation in fossils in amber. Here we show exceptionally slow racemisation rates during thermal degradation experiments of resin enclosed feathers, relative to previous thermal degradation experiments of ostrich eggshell, coral skeleton, and limpet shell. We also recover amino acids from two specimens of fossil feathers in amber. The amino acid compositions are broadly similar to those of degraded feathers, but concentrations are very low, suggesting that much of the original protein has been degraded and lost. High levels of racemisation in more apolar, slowly racemising amino acids suggest that some of the amino acids were ancient and therefore original. Our findings indicate that the unique fossilisation environment inside amber shows potential for the recovery of ancient amino acids and proteins.","[McCoy, Victoria E.] Univ Bonn, Steinmann Inst Geol Mineral & Palaontol, Nussallee 8, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [McCoy, Victoria E.; Gabbott, Sarah E.] Univ Leicester, Sch Geog Geol & Environm, Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; [Penkman, Kirsty] Univ York, Dept Chem, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Collins, Matthew J.; Presslee, Samantha] Univ York, Dept Archaeol, BioArCh, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Collins, Matthew J.] Univ Copenhagen, Nat Hist Museum Denmark, Ostervoldgade 5-7, DK-1350 Copenhagen K, Denmark; [Holt, John; Grossman, Harrison] Univ Leicester, Space Res Ctr, Dept Phys & Astron, Univ Rd, Leicester LE1 7RH, Leics, England; [Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Kraemer, Monica M.

These well preserved fossils provide newmorphological data for a cladistic analysis of the basal lineages of Vespidae. Results suggest that Euparagiinae is the sister group of all other Vespidae. The new genus Protovespa appears more closely related to extant Masarinae, Eumeninae and social wasps than to Priorvespinae. We assign it to a new subfamily: Protovespinae.

The evolutionary history of Nemopteridae is largely unknown due to the scarcity of fossil records. Here we report a new genus and species of Nemopteridae (Cretocroce xiai gen. et sp.n.) based on an exquisitely preserved adult specimen in mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber. We place the new genus in the subfamily Crocinae, which is characterized by filamentous hindwings with a sensory function as an adaptation to their cavernicolous habitats. The new genus represents the first nemopterid in amber and the oldest crocine known to date. The new fossil crocine is nearly morphologically unchanged over 99 Ma compared with its modern counterparts. Moreover, it is estimated to be closely related to some extant crocines endemic to South America based on morphological phylogenetic analysis. The new finding provides direct evidence to demonstrate the antiquity of Crocinae morphological innovation and related biology, such as pollenophagous habits, and further corroborates Gondwanan origin of the subfamily.","[Lu, Xiumei; Liu, Xingyue] China Agr Univ, Dept Entomol, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lu, Xiumei] Shanghai Acad Agr Sci, Inst Ecol & Environm Protect, Shanghai 201403, Peoples R China","Liu, XY (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Dept Entomol, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",xingyue_liu@yahoo.com,"Liu, Xingyue/A-3019-2013","Liu, Xingyue/0000-0002-9168-0659; Lu, Xiumei/0000-0002-3494-7871","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31672322, 41572010, 41622201, 41688103]; Beijing Natural Science FoundationBeijing Natural Science Foundation [5162016]; Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDPB05]","We thank Mr Fangyuan Xia (Shanghai) for providing the amber specimen herein studied.

Three genera and three species, Diversinitus attenboroughi gen. & sp. n., Burminata caputaeria gen. & sp. n. and Glabiala barbata gen. & sp. n. are described in the family Diversinitidae fam. n., from Lower Cretaceous Burmese amber. Placement in Chalcidoidea is supported by the presence of multiporous plate sensilla on the antennal flagellum and a laterally exposed prepectus. The new taxa can be excluded from all extant family level chalcidoid lineages by the presence of multiporous plate sensilla on the first flagellomere in both sexes and lack of any synapomorphies. Accordingly, a new family is proposed for the fossils and its probable phylogenetic position within Chalcidoidea is discussed. Morphological cladistic analyses of the new fossils within the Heraty et al. (2013) dataset did not resolve the phylogenetic placement of Diversinitidae, but indicated its monophyly. Phylogenetically relevant morphological characters of the new fossils are discussed with reference to Cretaceous and extant chalcidoid taxa.

(mid-Cretaceous Myanmar amber) is the first extinct member of the suborder Myxophaga to reveal fine morphological structures, studied by synchrotron microtomography. A comprehensive phylogenetic analysis places it as a stem group in the extant relict family Lepiceridae. The fossil (along with previously known taxa) demonstrates that lepicerids with seven and five antennomeres co-existed during mid-Cretaceous, and only forms with extremely reduced, pentamerous antennae survived till present. The hitherto known fossil record of the enigmatic myxophagan beetles and phylogenetic reconstructions demonstrate that the reduction of antennomeres (i.e. antennal anarthrogenesis) from the ancestral 11 to seven took place as early as the Triassic, when the ancestral lineage of Myxophaga split into the 'lepicerid lineage' and an ancestor of all remaining families. Furthermore, the anarthrogenesis in the 'Lepicerus lineage' had been completed by the mid-Cretaceous. As all remaining morphological structures that define extant Lepicerus had differentiated by then, the extreme reduction of antennae to merely five antennomeres was the last major morphological transformation in their evolution. Morphological adaptations to protect body appendages (presumably against predators) also remained unchanged since the mid-Cretaceous, indicating a similar environmental pressures during this nearly 100 Ma-long period of lepicerid evolution.","[Jaloszynski, Pawel] Univ Wroclaw, Museum Nat Hist, Sienkiewicza 21, PL-50335 Wroclaw, Poland; [Luo, Xiao-Zhu; Beutel, Rolf G.] FSU Jena, Inst Zool & Evolutionsforsch, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Hammel, Joerg U.] DESY, Inst Mat Res, Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Outstn, Bldg 66,Notkestr 85, D-22607 Hamburg, Germany; [Yamamoto, Shuhei] Field Museum Nat Hist, Integrat Res Ctr, 1400 S Lake Shore Dr, Chicago, IL 60605 USA","Jaloszynski, P (corresponding author), Univ Wroclaw, Museum Nat Hist, Sienkiewicza 21, PL-50335 Wroclaw, Poland.",scydmaenus@yahoo.com,"Yamamoto, Shuhei/U-8247-2018; Hammel, Jorg/D-6555-2011","Yamamoto, Shuhei/0000-0002-4162-8457; Hammel, Jorg/0000-0002-6744-6811; Beutel, Rolf Georg/0000-0002-0433-7626",,,,48,0,1,3,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1477-2019,1478-0941,,J SYST PALAEONTOL,J.

While some unknown cockroach mutation might have the same symptoms, ontogenetic defects (such as incomplete moulting) differ in complete lack of sclerotization, modified forewing bases and presence onboth wings.

This species is characterized by the rather small body size (0.59 mm) and structural similarities with different staphylinoid groups. The particular development of the legs of the new taxa shows some similarities with those of small and medium-sized jumping beetles from the superfamilies Scirtoidea, Buprestoidea, Tenebrionoidea, Chrysomeloidea and Curculionoidea. However, jumping beetles of these groups have strong femora and tibiae with large spurs and thick apical setae only on the posterior legs while P. zasukhae sp. nov. demonstrates such features on both mid and posterior legs. Another particularity of P. zasukhae sp. nov. is the unusual large femoral plate of metacoxae extending behind the suture between ventrites 2 and 3. Strong development of these structures are rare among Coleoptera and occurs in different taxonomic groups without close relationship. The studies were carried out with the usage of usual conventional light microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Leptochirini, which is primarily found in decaying wood in the tropics, is one of the four tribes of osoriine rove beetles. The diversity of cephalic tooth shapes in adults has attracted special research attention with regard to the evolution and classification of this group. Here, we report two well-preserved fossils of Leptochirini for the first time from Burmese amber. Together with M. longiantennatus, they represent the oldest osoriines, highlighting the palaeodiversity of the subfamily in Burmese amber. Based on our observations and phylogenetic analyses, a remarkable new genus and species, dagger Cretochirus newtoni Yamamoto gen. et sp.n., is described. Additionally, a new species, dagger Priochirus thayerae Yamamoto sp.n., is also described and placed in the extant genus Priochirus Sharp. dagger Cretochirus gen.n. has a typical body plan of Leptochirini, but it retains several primitive features that have rarely, or never, been known from modern leptochirine taxa, including simple cephalic structures with a largely depressed dorsum, undeveloped cephalic teeth, and the absence of a longitudinal median sulcus of the head, together with the only slightly crenulate external margins of the protibiae. These findings demonstrate the antiquity of Leptochirini rove beetles and even suggest a much older origin of the subfamily. Morphologically diverse leptochirines from Burmese amber also illuminate the remarkable cephalic diversity of the tribe during the Mesozoic. They were already diversified during the mid-Cretaceous in the tropical forests of Myanmar, and possibly living underneath the bark of rotten wood and logs.

Four species are described from Baltic amber: Tyrannothroscus rex n. sp., Pseudothroscus balticus n. sp., Potergus superbus n. sp. and Trixagus parvulus n. sp. Pactopus burmensis n. sp. is described from Burmese amber. A phylogenetic analysis of the known throscid genera is performed. Aulonothroscus Horn and Trixagus Kugelann are shown to be sister-groups, the sister-group of this Glade is the genus Pactopus Horn and the sister group of these three genera is the genus Potergus Bonvouloir. The oldest previously known throscids were species belonging to the genera Rhomboaspis Kirejtshuk & Kovalev and Potergosoma Kirejtshuk & Kovalev, both from Lebanese Amber, 125-135 Mya. The present analysis shows that the extinct Baltic amber genera Jaira Muona and Pseudothroscus belong to clades at least as old as the Lebanese fossils. The Burmese amber fossil Pactopus burmensis, 99 Mya, is considerably older than any of the previously known species belonging to the four extant genera: Pactopus,Potergus, Aulonothroscus or Trixagus. At least three throscid lineages are now known to have gone extinct. Both the Pactopus and Potergus lineages are more than 99 milion years old, whereas the Aulonothroscus and Trixagus lineages extend at least to the Baltic amber, 50 million years ago. The presence of Jaira in Baltic amber shows that that lineage persisted at least 80 million years before going to extinction.","[Muona, Jyrki] Univ Helsinki, Zool Unit, Finnish Museum Nat Hist, Entomol Team, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Muona, J (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Zool Unit, Finnish Museum Nat Hist, Entomol Team, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",Jyrki.muona@helsinki.fi,,"Muona, Jyrki/0000-0003-2771-1171",,,,23,3,4,0,1,MAGNOLIA PRESS,AUCKLAND,"PO BOX 41383, AUCKLAND, ST LUKES 1030, NEW ZEALAND",1175-5326,1175-5334,,ZOOTAXA,Zootaxa,APR 3,2019,4576,3,,,,,521,543,,10.11646/zootaxa.4576.3.6,,,23,Zoology,Zoology,HR4HT,WOS:000463107300006,31715751,Green Published,,,2021-07-18

In the modern fauna, these tiny phytophages comprise insects of great ecological and economic importance, like aphids (Aphidomorpha), scale insects (Coccidomorpha), whiteflies (Aleyrodomorpha) and psyllids (Psylloidea). Their evolutionary history can be traced back to the Late Carboniferous, but the early stages of their evolution and diversification is poorly understood, with two known extinct groups-Pincombeomorpha and Naibiomorpha variously placed in classifications and relationships hypotheses. Most of the recent Sternorrhyncha groups radiated rapidly during the Cretaceous. Here we report the new finding of very specialised sternorrhynchans found as inclusions in mid-Cretaceous amber from Kachin state (northern Myanmar), which represent another extinct lineage within this hemipteran suborder. These fossils, proposed to be placed in a new infraorder, are revealed to be related to whiteflies and psyllids.

Postopsyllidium emilyae is also the first record of the group from the Western Hemisphere. A catalogue of Protopsyllidiidae is provided as well as an hypothesis of phylogenetic relationships among genera, though monophyly of the family is ambiguous. Postopsyllidium appears to be a recently derived genus, and four genera are removed from the family. Complete preservation in amber allows new insight into relationships, specifically that Postopsyllidium, and perhaps most or all Protopsyllidiidae, represent an extinct sister group to the Sternorrhyncha that retain features of some Auchenorrhyncha.

Here, we demonstrate this approach by reconstructing the geographical origin and sequence of intercontinental colonization of the golden orbweaving spiders, a global clade. We test two alternative hypotheses about their ancestral range. Due to the highest contemporary species diversity in Africa, the 'Out of Africa' hypothesis predicts the Afrotropics as their most likely ancestral area. The alternative, 'Out of West Burma' hypothesis aims to explain a Burmese amber fossil as stem nephilid. Because the West Burma block probably detached from Australia, then rafted towards Laurasia, either on its own or with India, this hypothesis predicts either Australasia or Indomalaya (or both) as the ancestral area. Location Worldwide. Taxon Golden orbweaving spiders, family Nephilidae. Methods We construct an expanded phylogeny of nephilid spiders and apply RASP (Reconstruct Ancestral State in Phylogenies) to infer their global biogeographical history. We fit the data to six integrated biogeographical models: DEC, DIVALIKE, BAYAREALIKE and their +j variants. We fine-tune the analysis by evaluating varying probabilities of dispersal between geographical areas throughout the clade's evolutionary history. We use the physical distance between the areas as a proxy for dispersal probabilities, thus accounting for plate tectonics. Results The best supported model reconstructs both Australasia and Indomalaya as ancestral area. In several parts of the phylogeny, these areas persist for the estimated 130-million-year evolutionary history. However, numerous intercontinental shifts in nephilid biogeographical history are also inferred. Since nephilid origins are clearly Gondwanan, our study supports the interpretations that Burmese amber contains Gondwanan biota. Main conclusions These results are consistent with the Out of West Burma hypothesis but reject the Out of Africa hypothesis. That certain clades persist in their ancestral ranges while others may shift continents aligns well with the known nephilid biology. Our methodological approach that assesses organismal specific dispersal probabilities through concrete distances measured though time slices of the Earth's history can be applied to biogeographical reconstruction of any lineage.","[Turk, Eva; Kralj-Fiser, Simona; Kuntner, Matjaz] ZRC SAZU, Inst Biol, Evolutionary Zool Lab, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Turk, Eva] Univ Ljubljana, Biotech Fac, Dept Biol, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Candek, Klemen; Kuntner, Matjaz] Natl Inst Biol, Dept Organisms & Ecosyst Res, Evolutionary Zool Lab, Ljubljana, Slovenia; [Kuntner, Matjaz] Smithsonian Inst, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Dept Entomol, Washington, DC 20560 USA; [Kuntner, Matjaz] Hubei Univ, Coll Life Sci, Ctr Behav Ecol & Evolut, Wuhan, Peoples R China","Kuntner, M (corresponding author), Natl Inst Biol, Ljubljana, Slovenia.",matjaz.kuntner@nib.si,,"Turk, Eva/0000-0002-4263-6432; Kuntner, Matjaz/0000-0002-0057-2178","Javna Agencija za Raziskovalno Dejavnost RSSlovenian Research Agency - Slovenia [1000-17-0618, J1-9163, P1-0255, P1-0236]","Javna Agencija za Raziskovalno Dejavnost RS, Grant/Award Number: 1000-17-0618, J1-9163, P1-0255 and P1-0236",,70,4,4,1,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-0270,1365-2699,,J BIOGEOGR,J.

PfK13 is essential for asexual erythrocytic development, but its function is not known. We tagged the PfK13 protein with green fluorescent protein in P. falciparum to study its expression and localization in asexual and sexual stages. We used a new antibody against PfK13 to show that the PfK13 protein is expressed ubiquitously in both asexual erythrocytic stages and gameto-cytes and is localized in punctate structures, partially overlapping an endoplasmic reticulum marker. We introduced into the 3D7 strain four PfK13 mutations (F446I, N458Y, C469Y, and F495L) identified in parasites from the China-Myanmar border area and characterized the in vitro artemisinin response phenotypes of the mutants. We found that all the parasites with the introduced PfK13 mutations showed higher survival rates in the ring-stage survival assay (RSA) than the wild-type (WT) control, but only parasites with N458Y displayed a significantly higher RSA value (26.3%) than the WT control. After these PfK13 mutations were reverted back to the WT in field parasite isolates, all revertant parasites except those with the C469Y mutation showed significantly lower RSA values than their respective parental isolates. Although the 3D7 parasites with introduced F446I, the predominant PfK13 mutation in northern Myanmar, did not show significantly higher RSA values than the WT, they had prolonged ring-stage development and showed very little fitness cost in in vitro culture competition assays. In comparison, parasites with the N458Y mutations also had a prolonged ring stage and showed upregulated resistance pathways in response to artemisinin, but this mutation produced a significant fitness cost, potentially leading to their lower prevalence in the Greater Mekong subregion. IMPORTANCE Artemisinin resistance has emerged in Southeast Asia, endangering the substantial progress in malaria elimination worldwide. It is associated with mutations in the PfK13 protein, but how PfK13 mediates artemisinin resistance is not completely understood. Here we used a new antibody against PfK13 to show that the PfK13 protein is expressed in all stages of the asexual intraerythrocytic cycle as well as in gametocytes and is partially localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. By introducing four PfK13 mutations into the 3D7 strain and reverting these mutations in field parasite isolates, we determined the impacts of these mutations identified in the parasite populations from northern Myanmar on the ring stage using the in vitro ring survival assay. The introduction of the N458Y mutation into the 3D7 background significantly increased the survival rates of the ring-stage parasites but at the cost of the reduced fitness of the parasites. Introduction of the F446I mutation, the most prevalent PfK13 mutation in northern Myanmar, did not result in a significant increase in ring-stage survival after exposure to dihydroartemisinin (DHA), but these parasites showed extended ring-stage development. Further, parasites with the F446I mutation showed only a marginal loss of fitness, partially explaining its high frequency in northern Myanmar. Conversely, reverting all these mutations, except for the C469Y mutation, back to their respective wild types reduced the ringstage survival of these isolates in response to in vitro DHA treatment.","[Siddiqui, Faiza Amber; Boonhok, Rachasak; Mbenda, Huguette Gaelle Ngassa; Min, Hui; Liang, Xiaoying; Qin, Junling; Miao, Jun; Cui, Liwang] Univ S Florida, Dept Internal Med, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; [Cabrera, Mynthia] Penn State Univ, Dept Biochem & Mol Biol, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Wang, Meilian; Min, Hui; Zhu, Xiaotong; Cao, Yaming] China Med Univ, Coll Basic Med Sci, Shenyang, Liaoning, Peoples R China","Cui, LW (corresponding author), Univ S Florida, Dept Internal Med, Tampa, FL 33620 USA.",liwangcui@usf.edu,"Siddiqui, Faiza Amber/Q-2191-2015","Liang, Xiaoying/0000-0002-6603-3724; MIAO, JUN/0000-0001-9374-6749","National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [U19AI 089672, R01AI128940]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [81761128017]","This study was supported by grants U19AI 089672 and R01AI128940 from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health.

L. schleei, and L. succini. All are preserved in Miocene amber from the Dominican Republic; today Hispaniola harbours only two known species of this genus. Recent Lutzomyia feed oil a wide variety of terrestrial vertebrates, including reptiles, birds, and mammals. Three rare pieces of the amber are reported, two described in detail, which preserved assemblages of Lutzomyia swarms with strands of mammalian hair, indicating that at least some of the fossil species were mammal feeders. Microstructure of the fossil hair offers little diagnostic evidence, but is very similar to that of insectivores in the Solenodontidae. Further preserved evidence indicates that the fossil midges swarmed about an arboreal nest or site of decayed wood that was worked by a mammal, but at very specific times during formation of the amber. Other very rare Dominican amber pieces containing a flea and an ixodid tick also contain mammalian hairs of similar microstructure, together with Lutzomyia sandflies, possibly reflecting the ectoparasite community of a Miocene mammal. This parasitic association has implications regarding the evolution of vectors of mammalian pathogens like Leishmania and the study further reveals the extent of palaeobiological inference that is possible with amber.","Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, New York, NY 10024 USA","Penalver, E (corresponding author), Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, Cent Pk W & 79th St, New York, NY 10024 USA.",penalver@amnh.org; grimaldi@amnh.org,,"Penalver Molla, Enrique/0000-0001-8312-6087",,,,73,17,19,0,11,ROYAL SOC EDINBURGH,EDINBURGH,"22-26 GEORGE ST, EDINBURGH EH2 2PQ, MIDLOTHIAN, SCOTLAND",0263-5933,,,T ROY SOC EDIN-EARTH,Trans.

Fossilized galleries of scolytines have been reported in Late Mesozoic wood, but here we describe a well-preserved body fossil from the Cretaceous, c. 100 Ma, preserved in amber from northern Myanmar. Moreover, the specimen is remarkably similar to Recent species of the genus Microborus, revealing stasis unexpected within scolytines and thus highlighting the antiquity of the group. Stratigraphic dating and comparison of insect palaeofaunas included in other well-dated ambers from multiple sites support the age estimate of the Burmese amber. A minimum age for one clade of scolytines is thus established, indicating an early divergence of scolytines from other weevils in the Late Jurassic or Early Cretaceous and challenging the current perspective of weevil evolution.","[Cognato, Anthony I.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Entomol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Grimaldi, David] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, New York, NY 10024 USA","Cognato, AI (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Entomol, 243 Nat Sci Bldg, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",cognato@msu.edu,,,"NSF PEETNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0328920, DEB-0542726]","We thank Roger Beaver (Chiangmai, Thailand), Jiri Hulcr (MSU), Bjarte Jordal (University of Bergen), Mikhail Mandelshtam (Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg), Aaron Smith (MSU), Alexander Kirejtshuk (Russian Academy of Sciences), and Stephen L.

We report here four additional adult specimens of the same lineage, one of which was described using a successful reconstruction from a CT-scan analysis to better observe some characters. The new specimens enabled us to considerably improve the diagnosis of Mysteriomorphidae. The family is definitively placed in Elateroidea, and we hypothesize its close relationship with Elateridae. Similarly, there are other fossil families of beetles that are exclusively described from Cretaceous ambers. These lineages may have been evolutionarily replaced by the ecological revolution launched by angiosperms that introduced new co-associations with taxa. These data indicate a macroevolutionary pattern of replacement that could be extended to other insect groups.","[Peris, David; Maehler, Bastian; Rust, Jes] Univ Bonn, Inst Geosci, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Kundrata, Robin] Palacky Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, Olomouc 77900, Czech Republic; [Delclos, Xavier] Univ Barcelona, Dept Dinam Terra & Ocea, Fac Geol, Barcelona 08028, Spain; [Delclos, Xavier] Univ Barcelona, Inst Recerca Biodiversitat IRBio, Fac Geol, Barcelona 08028, Spain; [Ivie, Michael A.] Montana State Univ, Montana Entomol Collect, Bozeman, MT 59717 USA; [Labandeira, Conrad C.] Smithsonian Inst, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Dept Paleobiol, Washington, DC 20013 USA; [Labandeira, Conrad C.] Univ Maryland, Ecol Evolut & Systemat Program, Dept Entomol & Behav, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Labandeira, Conrad C.] Capital Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China","Peris, D (corresponding author), Univ Bonn, Inst Geosci, D-53115 Bonn, Germany.; Kundrata, R (corresponding author), Palacky Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, Olomouc 77900, Czech Republic.",daperce@gmail.com; robin.kundrata@upol.cz,"KUNDRATA, Robin/AAI-5445-2021",,Projekt DEAL,Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.,,53,3,4,0,0,NATURE RESEARCH,BERLIN,"HEIDELBERGER PLATZ 3, BERLIN, 14197, GERMANY",2045-2322,,,SCI REP-UK,Sci Rep,OCT 8,2020,10,1,,,,,,,16854,10.1038/s41598-020-73724-7,,,9,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science & Technology - Other Topics,OA0GJ,WOS:000577475100078,33033283,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2021-07-18

We discuss the differences between the middle Eocene Baltic amber genus Archankothrips and Ankothrips, concluding that the two genera are extremely similar with only one significant difference in male specimens. The disjunctive distribution of the extant species along with the presence of one Late Cretaceous species strongly suggest an Early Cretaceous origin for Ankothrips. The genus is therefore very ancient and has had a remarkable morphological stability for the last 94 million years. This situation is unique among the Cretaceous thrips, and rare among insects (only c. 3% of the genera in the well-documented mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber are still extant).

The new genus resembles some modern Afrotropical and Indomalayan idiocerine genera but differs in having the gena relatively narrow. Archipedionis obscurus gen. and sp. n., is the first well-preserved fossil representative of Macropsini to be described in detail. Previous reports of this tribe from Baltic amber, while credible, included too little morphological information to assess their relationships. Additional comparative notes are provided for previously described fossil taxa belonging to Idiocerini and Macropsini from the Oligocene of Germany.

Here, mites of the families Tarsocheylidae, Dolichocybidae, and Acarophenacidae are described, with Tarsocheylidae and Dolichocybidae recorded for the first time from amber. A new genus and four new species are described, namely, Hoplocheylus similis sp. nov. (Tarsocheylidae), Dolichocybe elongata sp. nov. (Dolichocybidae), Proadactylidium fossibilis gen. and sp. nov. and Paradactylidium sineunguis sp. nov. (Acarophenacidae). The extant species Acarophenax lacunatus Cross and Krantz, 1964 and A. assanovi Livshitz and Mitrofanov, 1974 are transferred to the new genus Proadactylidium. A revised key to the genera of Acarophenacidae is presented.

The nodules are small (less than 10 mm in length), nearly 10,000 of which were screened, yielding several inclusions of fungi and plant fragments, but mostly terrestrial arthropods: 29 specimens in 10 orders and 13 families. The fungi include resinicolous hyphae and a dark, multiseptate hyphomycete. Plants include wood/bark fragments and fibers, and the microphylls of a bryophyte (probably a moss, Musci). Among the arthropods are arachnids: mites (Acari: Oribatida), Pseudoscorpionida, and the bodies and a silken cocoon of spiders (Araneae). Insecta include Blattodea, Thysanoptera, Hemiptera (Heteroptera and Aphidoidea), Coleoptera (Dermestidae: Megatominae), Trichoptera, Diptera (Chironomidae: Tanypodinae), and Hymenoptera (Formicidae: Formicinae). Nymphal aphids predominate (65% of the arthropod individuals), which were probably feeding on the source tree, likely Metasequoia. There is a bias in preservation toward small arthropods (mean body length 0.75 mm) that are surface-dwelling (nonwinged) stages and taxa. Chickaloon amber contains the most northerly fossil records of pseudoscorpions, thrips, Dermestidae, and Cenozoic ants and mites, so the deposit is contributing unique data on high-latitude paleodiversity of the Paleogene hothouse earth.","[Grimaldi, David A.; Nascimbene, Paul C.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Sunderlin, David; Aaroe, Georgene A.; Dempsky, Michelle R.; Parker, Nancy E.; Tillery, George Q.; White, Jaclyn G.] Lafayette Coll, Dept Geol & Environm Geosci, Easton, PA 18042 USA; [Barden, Phillip] New Jersey Inst Technol, Dept Biol, Newark, NJ 07102 USA; [Williams, Christopher J.] Franklin & Marshall Coll, Dept Earth & Environm, Lancaster, PA 17604 USA","Grimaldi, DA (corresponding author), Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, New York, NY 10024 USA.",,"Williams, Christopher/AAX-6843-2020",,"Keck Geology Consortium [NSF-REU 0648782, NSF-REU1062720]; National Geographic Society Committee for Research and Exploration GrantNational Geographic Society [9109-12]; Lafayette College; Franklin & Marshall College","D.S. and C.J.W. are grateful for generous funding through the Keck Geology Consortium (NSF-REU 0648782 and NSF-REU1062720), and the National Geographic Society Committee for Research and Exploration Grant #9109-12, Lafayette College and Franklin & Marshall College.

We report herein three male winged stick insects, assigned to Pterophasmatidae fam. nov., from mid-Cretaceous Myanmar (Burmese) amber. Pterophasmatidae fam. nov. are regarded as transitional taxa from extinct winged to modern wingless and shorter winged stick insects based on their similar tegmina venation with extinct Susumanioidea and some body features the same as extant Phasmatodea. However, their symmetric phallic organs comprising two consistent phallomeres are different from those of all living groups. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that the extinct winged taxa, including the new family, are the stem groups of modern stick and leaf insects, and all of them constitute the clade of Phasmatodea. New findings indicate winged and wingless stick insects' morphologies diversified significantly during or before the mid-Cretaceous.","[Yang, Hongru; Lin, Xiaodan; Shih, Chungkun; Ren, Dong; Gao, Taiping] Capital Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, 105 Xisanhuanbeilu, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China; [Yin, Xiangchu] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Plateau Biol, 23 Xinning Rd, Xining 810008, Qinghai, Peoples R China; [Wang, Chen] Capital Med Univ, Sch Hlth Adm & Educ, 10 Xitoutiao, Beijing 100069, Peoples R China; [Shih, Chungkun] Smithsonian Inst, Dept Paleobiol, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Washington, DC 20013 USA; [Zhang, Weiwei] POB 4680, Chongqing 400015, Peoples R China","Ren, D; Gao, TP (corresponding author), Capital Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, 105 Xisanhuanbeilu, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China.",rendong@mail.cnu.edu.cn; tpgao@cnu.edu.cn,"Gao, Taiping/Z-3987-2019","Gao, Taiping/0000-0002-8118-8708","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31872277, 31730087, 41688103]; Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in UniversityProgram for Changjiang Scholars & Innovative Research Team in University (PCSIRT) [IRT-17R75]; Support Project of High-level Teachers in Beijing Municipal Universities in the Period of 13th Five-year Plan [IDHT20180518]; Beijing Natural Science FoundationBeijing Natural Science Foundation [5182004]","D.R. was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (nos 31730087 and 41688103), the Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University (IRT-17R75) and Support Project of High-level Teachers in Beijing Municipal Universities in the Period of 13th Five-year Plan (no.

A new series of 19 specimens with excellent preservation allows description and redescription of virtually all morphological details. Male terminalia are very similar to those of the Holarctic Recent family of snow fleas:' the Boreidae. Thoracic sderites are highly convergent with nematocerous Diptera in the expansion of the mesothorax and great reduction of the proand metathoraces. The metathoracic wing vestige appears to be just the teg-ula; axial sderites are lost. Details of the pretarsal claws are described; in P paraburrniticus Grimaldi and Rasnitsyn the outer claw of the meso- and metathoracic pretarsi is elongate and the inner claw reduced. The proboscis is comprised not of a labial tube and pseudolabellum (contra Ren et al., 2009), but is mostly m'aiillary in tlrigin, with the outer valves probably being galeae and the central, serrated stylet probably the hypopharynx. Abdominal stemites are greatly reduced (more so in females), suggesting that the abdomen was distensible, a feature that is common in some fluid-feeding insects. The proboscis, claw, and sternite modifications indicate that Parapolycentropus fed on the hemolymph of small insects, not the blood of vertebrates.","[Grimaldi, David; Johnston, M.

This study concludes that the ovipositor of Zhenia is most likely formed from abdominal eighth and ninth segments instead of the cerci, as a previous study found.","[Zhang, Qingqing] Univ Sci & Technol China, Hefei 230026, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qingqing] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Junfeng] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Zhang, JF (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",jfzhang@nigpas.ac.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41572010, 41622201, 41688103]; Strategic Priority Research Program (B) of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB26000000]; State Key Laboratory of Palaeobiology and Stratigraphy (Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, CAS)Chinese Academy of Sciences [183101]","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41572010, 41622201, 41688103), the Strategic Priority Research Program (B) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDB26000000), and the State Key Laboratory of Palaeobiology and Stratigraphy (Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, CAS) (183101).",,29,0,2,0,3,PENSOFT PUBLISHERS,SOFIA,"12 PROF GEORGI ZLATARSKI ST, SOFIA, 1700, BULGARIA",1435-1951,1522-2403,,DEUT ENTOMOL Z,Dtsch.

They are major contributors to modern terrestrial ecosystems, and have a deep evolutionary history. Whip spiders (Arachnida, Amblypygi), are one of the smaller arachnid orders with ca. 190 living species. Here we restudy one of the oldest fossil representatives of the group, Graeophonus anglicus Pocock, 1911 from the Late Carboniferous (Duckmantian, ca. 315 Ma) British Middle Coal Measures of the West Midlands, UK. Using X-ray microtomography, our principal aim was to resolve details of the limbs and mouthparts which would allow us to test whether this fossil belongs in the extant, relict family Paracharontidae; represented today by a single, blind species Paracharon caecus Hansen, 1921. Results: Tomography reveals several novel and significant character states for G. anglicus; most notably in the chelicerae, pedipalps and walking legs. These allowed it to be scored into a phylogenetic analysis together with the recently described Paracharonopsis cambayensis Engel & Grimaldi, 2014 from the Eocene (ca. 52 Ma) Cambay amber, and Kronocharon prendinii Engel & Grimaldi, 2014 from Cretaceous (ca. 99 Ma) Burmese amber. We recovered relationships of the form ((Graeophonus (Paracharonopsis + Paracharon)) + (Charinus (Stygophrynus (Kronocharon (Charon (Musicodamon + Paraphrynus)))))). This tree largely reflects Peter Weygoldt's 1996 classification with its basic split into Paleoamblypygi and Euamblypygi lineages; we were able to score several of his characters for the first time in fossils. Our analysis draws into question the monophyly of the family Charontidae. Conclusions: Our data suggest that Graeophonus is a crown group amblypygid, and falls within a monophyletic Paleoamblypgi clade, but outside the family Paracharontidae (= Paracharonopsis + Paracharon). Our results also suggest a new placement for the Burmese amber genus Kronocharon, a node further down from its original position. Overall, we offer a broad phylogenetic framework for both the fossil and Recent whip spiders against which future discoveries can be tested.","[Garwood, Russell J.] Univ Manchester, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Garwood, Russell J.] Nat Hist Museum, Dept Earth Sci, Cromwell Rd, London SW7 5BD, England; [Dunlop, Jason A.] Leibniz Inst Res Evolut & Biodivers, Museum Nat Kunde, Invalidenstr 43, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Knecht, Brian J.; Hegna, Thomas A.] Western Illinois Univ, Dept Geol, Tillman Hall 113,1 Univ Circle, Macomb, IL 61455 USA","Garwood, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.; Garwood, RJ (corresponding author), Nat Hist Museum, Dept Earth Sci, Cromwell Rd, London SW7 5BD, England.",russell.garwood@manchester.ac.uk,"Hegna, Thomas/X-3568-2019; Dunlop, Jason A./AAC-8042-2019","Hegna, Thomas/0000-0001-9067-8787; Garwood, Russell/0000-0002-2803-9471","European Union SYNTHESYS grant; EPSRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/F007906/1, EP/F001452/1, EP/I02249X/1]; WIU Undergraduate Research Grant; WIU Department of Geology; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/F007906/1, EP/I02249X/1, EP/F001452/1] Funding Source: researchfish","RJG's visit to Berlin was supported by a European Union SYNTHESYS grant.

The well-preserved holotype allows clarification of the characteristics of the order. The first-studied hind wings are derived from the Dictyoptera ground plan. The membrane is transparent, veins are thickened and strongly sclerotized, and between C and SC2 is a conspicuous leathery lancet-shaped pterostigma. The wings are folded longitudinally back on the abdomen between the CuP and AA(1) veins in repose. The palaeobiology of Alienoptera is discussed based on the morphology of both known species. Alienopterans are inferred to have lived in trees or bushes with suitable foliage and were probably daytime active, visually oriented predators of small invertebrates.","[Kocarek, Petr] Univ Ostrava, Dept Biol & Ecol, CZ-71000 Ostrava, Czech Republic; [Kocarek, Petr] Univ Ostrava, Inst Environm Technol, CZ-71000 Ostrava, Czech Republic","Kocarek, P (corresponding author), Univ Ostrava, Dept Biol & Ecol, CZ-71000 Ostrava, Czech Republic.; Kocarek, P (corresponding author), Univ Ostrava, Inst Environm Technol, CZ-71000 Ostrava, Czech Republic.",Petr.Kocarek@osu.cz,"Kocarek, Petr/C-2989-2011","Kocarek, Petr/0000-0002-1739-0143","EU structural funding Operational Programme Research and Development for Innovation [1.05/2.1.00/19.0388]; Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech RepublicMinistry of Education, Youth & Sports - Czech Republic [LO1208]","This work was financially supported by EU structural funding Operational Programme Research and Development for Innovation, project no.

The modem fauna yields several morphotypes of lacewing larvae, each closely associated with a distinct evolutionary lineage within the group of lacewings, Neuroptera. Back in the Cretaceous, about 100 million years ago, many of these larval forms had already evolved. Additionally, many larval forms seem to have been present that are now extinct. We report here a new form, which appears to be extinct now. This new larva has a prominent forward projecting labrum like larval forms of Nevrorthidae and Psychopsidae. It furthermore has (again similar to the latter two) curved venom-injecting stylets formed by mandibles and maxillae. We used quantitative outline analysis to compare the new larva to those of Nevrorthidae and Psychopsidae. The results of this analysis demonstrate that the new larva differs in all aspects of head capsule shape from all known larvae of Nevrorthidae. Its head shape is more similar to that of many larvae of Psychopsidae, yet also here the new larva differs recognisably in one principal component. Also qualitative differences clearly differentiate the new larva from already known ones. Hence, the new larva represents a new, so far unknown morphotype of lacewing larva. This finding adds to the growing 'zoo' of unusual lacewing larvae back in the Cretaceous, indicating that form diversity and ecological diversity of lacewings were much higher 100 million years ago.","[Haug, Joachim T.; Pazinato, Paula G.; Haug, Gideon T.; Haug, Carolin] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Biol, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany; [Haug, Joachim T.; Haug, Carolin] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, GeoBioctr, Richard Wagner Str 10, D-80333 Munich, Germany","Haug, JT (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Biol, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany.",joachim.haug@palaeo-evo-devo.info; paula.pazinato@palaeo-evo-devo.info; gideon.haug@palaeo-evo-devo.info; carolin.haug@palaeo-evo-devo.info,,,"Volkswagen FoundationVolkswagen; Capes/Doctoral Program (CAPES/DAAD/CNPQ) [88887.161379/2017-00, 15-2017]; LMUexcellent Junior Researcher Fund","The study was supported by the Volkswagen Foundation via a Lichtenberg professorship to JTH.

Cybella n. gen. is proposed for Cybella deharvengi n. sp. (type species), collected from an isolated limestone hill in Hon Chong Province, Vietnam, and C. bedosae n. sp., found in a limestone cave in Kampuchea, Cambodia. Cybella species seem to be restricted to karst formations and are probably troglophilic. The type localities of the two known species are threatened by quarrying activities, these being particularly pressing in the case of C. deharvengi n. sp. Cybella shows important differences from other Feaellidae that require a modification of the familial diagnosis and justify the erection of a new subfamily, Cybellinae. The discovery of this group provides insights into the evolution of the unusual morphology of the family, notably concerning the pleural plates of Feaellinae, which are lacking in Cybellinae. The smaller sclerites of the pleura of Pseudogarypidae and Feaellidae are shown to be muscle apodemes, which provide an additional synapomorphy for Feaelloidea. Two types of coxal spines, termed primary and secondary, are distinguished in Feaelloidea, based on the presence of a lumen within the primary spines and its absence in secondary spines. The new morphological term atrial plate is proposed for a sclerotized plate of the male genitalia, extending between the lateral rods and the lateral apodemes. Claims that the internal genital setae of males of non-chthonioid pseudoscorpions are secretory are reviewed and found to lack support. Additional information concerning the fossil genus Protofeaella Henderickx, 2016 is provided, based on an adult male in amber from the Cretaceous (lowermost Cenomanian) of Myanmar. Protofeaella shares with Cybella the absence of pleural plates and the antiaxial position of the chemosensory setae of the movable chelal finger. However, it differs from both Cybellinae and Feaellinae in having relatively long chelal fingers that lack a tuberculate basal tooth, both of which are interpreted as symplesiomorphic states within Feaellidae. Protofeaella is therefore provisionally treated as a stem-group feaellid and not assigned to a subfamily. The existence of a Cretaceous member of the Pseudogarypidae is noted in the mid-Cretaceous (late Albian-early Cenomanian) of Germany, representing the oldest record of this family.","[Judson, Mark L.

NOV COLEOPTERA; BURMESE AMBER; GEN.; CURCULIONIDAE; PHYLOGENY; FAMILY; TENEBRIONOIDEA; ELMIDAE; GEOLOGY; RESINS,"Beetles, the most successful group of invertebrates on Earth, have a worldwide distribution and an outstanding fossil record. In addition, they are well known as inclusions in fossil resin. In historical studies of fossil material, specimens were often named and described without placing the taxa in an ecological context. However, the research philosophy for fossil beetles has changed over the past few years. In this article, we summarize the palaeoecological interpretations of fossil beetles from Cretaceous ambers, which includes species from 69 families, most of which were described during the last 3 years. By analysing current habits of those families, we argue that saproxylicity was the most common feeding strategy for these fossil beetles. More specifically, fungivorous species appear to dominate. In contrast, we find only anecdotal evidence for the presence of wood-boring groups, and it is thus necessary to identify alternative abiotic or biotic processes that are responsible for the copious resin production at this time. Finally, the recent description of some beetles as gymnosperm pollinators during the Cretaceous lends more weight to the importance of amber studies in addressing the role of beetles in the evolution of pollination strategies.","[Peris, David; Rust, Jes] Rheinische Friedrich Wilhelms Univ Bonn, Inst Geowissensch & Meteorol, D-53115 Bonn, Germany","Peris, D (corresponding author), Rheinische Friedrich Wilhelms Univ Bonn, Inst Geowissensch & Meteorol, D-53115 Bonn, Germany.",daperce@gmail.com,,,"Alexander von Humboldt Foundation from GermanyAlexander von Humboldt Foundation; Ministry of Science, Innovations and Universities from Spain (project 'CRE', Spanish Agencia Estatal de Investigacion/Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional) [UE CGL2017-84419]","We thank Xavier Delclos (Universitat de Barcelona, Spain) for help and suggestions with the first draft of this manuscript.

They are included in Corydioidea with Corydiidae. No fossil of this family was reported. Here we describe a stem member of Nocticolidae, Crenocticola burmanica gen. et sp. nov., from mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber. Its morphology appears plesiomorphic for Nocticolidae, and exhibits transitional form between crown Nocticolidae and Latindiinae (in Corydiidae). Placing Crenocticola in stem Nocticolidae is confirmed by a preliminary morphological phylogeny based on 28 non-genital characters. We use Crenocticola and published fossils to calibrate dating analyses of Corydioidea under autocorrelated TK02 relaxed clock model in MrBayes, and the analyses in turn test the power of Crenocticola as a node calibration. The dataset comprises published DNA (12S, 16S, 18S and 28S) of 19 ingroup taxa of Corydioidea, and eight outgroup taxa including termites. As a result, Crenocticola is too young to be an effective calibration. It is suppressed by the oldest fossil of termites, which may also be crucial in previous studies provided that unjustified fossil calibrations (e.g. 'roachoids') are excluded. We compare two approaches to applying fossil calibrations: 1) in-analytical calibration, i.e. incorporating the fossil age in prior settings, and 2) post-analytical calibration, i.e. adjusting the fixed prior so that the estimated age does not conflict with the fossil age. In-analytical calibration may underestimate the age, whilst post-analytical calibration yields better estimates. Our dating analyses suggest that crown Corydioidea likely originated in the Late Triassic or Early Jurassic. Questionable genera in Nocticolidae are briefly discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Although both insects and angiosperms were common by the mid-Cretaceous, direct fossil evidence of insect pollination is lacking. Direct evidence of Cretaceous insect pollination is associated with insect-gymnosperm pollination. Here, we report a specialized beetle-angiosperm pollination mode from mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber (99 mega-annum [Ma]) in which a tumbling flower beetle (Mordellidae), Angimordella burmitina gen. et sp. nov., has many tricolpate pollen grains attached. A. burmitina exhibits several specialized body structures for flower-visiting behavior including its body shape and pollen-feeding mouthparts revealed by X-ray microcomputed tomography (micro-CT). The tricolpate pollen in the amber belongs to the eudicots that comprise the majority of extant angiosperm species. These pollen grains exhibit zoophilous pollination attributes including their ornamentation, size, and clumping characteristics. Tricolpate pollen grains attached to the beetle's hairs are revealed by confocal laser scanning microscopy, which is a powerful tool for investigating pollen in amber. Our findings provide direct evidence of insect pollination of Cretaceous angiosperms, extending the range insect-angiosperm pollination association by at least 50 million years. Our results support the hypothesis that specialized insect pollination modes were present in eudicots 99 million years ago.","[Bao, Tong; Wang, Bo; Li, Jianguo] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Bao, Tong; Wang, Bo; Li, Jianguo] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Bao, Tong] Univ Bonn, Inst Geowissensch, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Dilcher, David] Indiana Univ, Dept Geol & Atmospher Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA","Wang, B (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China.; Wang, B (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China.; Wang, B (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.; Dilcher, D (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Geol & Atmospher Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",bowang@nigpas.ac.cn; dilcher@indiana.edu,"Chen, Huaihai/AAH-8972-2020","Chen, Huaihai/0000-0002-2121-1822; Dilcher, David/0000-0001-7226-6703; Bao, Tong/0000-0001-7510-593X","Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Grant [2019QZKK0706]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB26000000, XDA19050101]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41622201, 41688103, 41872004]; Key Laboratory of the Zoological Systematics and Evolution of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [Y229YX5105]","Thanks to B.

Both specimens were studied with light- and micro-CT technology, allowing a detailed reconstruction of the posterior telopods and numerous other morphological characters. Based on these characters, the specimens can be securely placed in the megadiverse, mainly Asiatic genus Hyleoglomeris Verhoeff, 1910 as a new species, Hyleoglomeris groehni n. sp. The species H. groehni n. sp. is the oldest and only known fossil member of the Glomerida that is sufficiently described to allow for placement in a family or genus. The discovery of a fossil Hyleoglomeris in Baltic amber has biogeographic implications as the genus is now speciose in Asia, with the nearest relatives found in the Caucasus and some caves in Serbia and Greece. With the discovery of a fossil European Hyleoglomeris species, the cave Hyleoglomeris species are interpreted as relicts, surviving underground as living witnesses of a different time when Hyleoglomeris was still extant in Europe. Other cave Glomerida in Europe, as well as morphologically aberrant pill millipede species endemic to the Canary Islands, should be checked for potential placement in Hyleoglomeris.

This aphid, herein named Koonwarraphis rotundafrons gen. & sp. nov., is assigned to the cosmopolitan Cretaceous superfamily Tajmyraphidoidea, which has been previously described from the Lebanese, Taimyrian, Canadian, Myanmar (Burmese), and Spanish ambers. Koonwarraphis rotundafrons is the first aphid recorded from the eastern Gondwanan landmass during the Cretaceous, and represents the only tajmyraphidoid preserved as a compression fossil, rather than as an amber inclusion. Due to the nature of the fossil's preservation, Koonwarraphis cannot be firmly placed in any of the described tajmyraphidoid families; however, all observable morphological features suggest that the genus is broadly typical of the superfamily and Cretaceous aphids in general. Koonwarraphis' shortened rostrum, a feature also seen in other tajmyraphidoids, suggests an association with the more herbaceous aspects of the Early Cretaceous Victorian flora. Considering the modern aphid preference for angiosperm plants, it is possible that this aphid was living upon the herbaceous early angiosperms recorded previously from the Koonwarra macrofloral assemblage.","[Martin, Sarah K.] Geol Survey Western Australia, 100 Plain St, East Perth, WA 6004, Australia; [Martin, Sarah K.] Western Australian Museum, Earth & Planetary Sci, Welshpool, WA 6101, Australia; [Skidmore, Luke I.] Dept Educ Tasmania, 73 Murray St, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Stilwell, Jeffrey D.] Monash Univ, Sch Earth Atmosphere & Environm, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Stilwell, Jeffrey D.] Australian Museum, 1 William St, Sydney, NSW 2010, Australia","Martin, SK (corresponding author), Geol Survey Western Australia, 100 Plain St, East Perth, WA 6004, Australia.; Martin, SK (corresponding author), Western Australian Museum, Earth & Planetary Sci, Welshpool, WA 6101, Australia.",martin.sarahk@gmail.com; l.i.skidmore@hotmail.com; jeffrey.stilwell@monash.edu,,"Stilwell, Jeffrey Darl/0000-0002-9853-1322",Monash UniversityMonash University; Australian Museum; Monash Research Initiatives grant,LIS Honours' work was sponsored by Monash University and a 2010 Geddes Post-graduate Award from the Australian Museum.

A revised definition and composition of Mesoraphidiidae (including Cretinocellia) is suggested. 'Siboptera' medialis is transferred to the genus Mesoraphidia. The synonymy of Alloraphidiidae with Mesoraphidiidae is rejected and Alloraphidiinae is restored as separate subfamily that probably represents the sister group of Mesoraphidiinae. The genera Caloraphidia, Styporaphidia and Ororaphidia are transferred to a new subfamily Ororaphidiinae within Mesoraphidiidae. The genus Metaraphidia is excluded from Mesoraphidiidae and attributed to a new monotypic family Metaraphidiidae, which is considered as sister group of Neoraphidioptera (Raphidiidae+Inocelliidae) within the new taxon Euraphidioptera, which is the sister group to Mesoraphidiidae within the new taxon Raphidiformia. Arariperaphidia rochai is transferred to Baissopteridae that might rather be a paraphyletic grade of basal stem group representatives.","[Bechly, Guenter; Wolf-Schwenninger, Karin] Staatliches Museum Nat Kunde, Abt Palaontol, D-70191 Stuttgart, Germany","Bechly, G (corresponding author), Staatliches Museum Nat Kunde, Abt Palaontol, Rosenstein 1, D-70191 Stuttgart, Germany.",guenter.bechly@smns-bw.de,"Bechly, Gunter/M-6302-2017","Bechly, Gunter/0000-0002-9162-4294",,,,20,17,20,0,7,APOLLO BOOKS,STENSTRUP,"KIRKEBY SAND, 19, DK-5771 STENSTRUP, DENMARK",1399-560X,,,INSECT SYST EVOL,Insect Syst.

However, only a single species of Cascomastigus has been known so far, and the paleodiversity of this peculiar group remains underexplored. Here we described another species, Cascomastigus minor Yin, Cai and Huang sp. nov., also from Burmese amber. The new species is distinctly smaller than C. monstrabilis, and may be further separated by the relatively longer antennomeres III, and much stouter maxillary palpomeres IV.

Results: Lutzomyia adiketis sp. n. (Phlebotomidae: Diptera) is described from Dominican amber as a vector of Paleoleishmania neotropicum sp. n. (Kinetoplastida: Trypanosomatidae). The fossil sand fly differs from all previously described extinct and extant members of the genus by the following combination of characters: Sc forked with the branches meeting the costa and radius veins; wing L/W value of 4.1; a delta value of 18; a ratio beta/alpha value of 0.86, and the shape and size of the spatulate rods on the ninth sternite. The trypanosomatid is characterized by the structure of its promastigotes, amastigotes and paramastigotes and its transmission by an extinct species of sand fly. Conclusion: Morphological characters show that the fossil sand fly is a new extinct species and that it is host to a digenetic species of trypanosomatid. This study provides the first fossil evidence that Neotropical sand flies were vectors of trypanosomatids in the mid-Tertiary (20-30 mya).","Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Poinar, G (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",poinarg@science.oregonstate.edu,,,,,,40,25,30,0,5,BIOMED CENTRAL LTD,LONDON,"236 GRAYS INN RD, FLOOR 6, LONDON WC1X 8HL, ENGLAND",1756-3305,,,PARASITE VECTOR,Parasites Vectors,JUL 15,2008,1,,,,,,1,8,22,10.1186/1756-3305-1-22,,,8,Parasitology; Tropical Medicine,Parasitology; Tropical Medicine,380FP,WOS:000261451900001,18627624,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2021-07-18

Investigations of past ecosystems offer additional insights to help better understand the processes underlying biodiversity. The Cretaceous period is of special interest in this context, especially with respect to arthropods. During that period, representatives of many modern lineages appeared for the first time, while representatives of more ancient groups also co-occurred. At the same time, side branches of radiating groups with 'experimental morphologies' emerged that seemed to go extinct shortly afterwards. However, larval forms, with their morphological diversity, are largely neglected in such studies, but may provide important insights into morphological and ecological diversity and its changes in the past. Results We present here a new fossil insectan larva, a larval lacewing, in Cretaceous amber, exhibiting a rather unusual, 'experimental' morphology. The specimen possesses extremely large (in relation to body size) mandibulo-maxillary piercing stylets. Additionally, the labial palps are very long and are subdivided into numerous elements, overall appearing antenniform. In other aspects, the larva resembles many other neuropteran-type larvae. Conclusions We provide a comparison that includes quantitative aspects of different types of neuropteran larvae to emphasise the exceptionality of the new larva, and discuss its possible relationships to known lineages of Neuroptera; possible interpretations are closer relationships to Dilaridae or Osmylidae. In any case, several of the observed characters must have evolved convergently. With this new find, we expand the known morphological diversity of neuropterans in the Cretaceous fauna.","[Haug, Joachim T.; Haug, Carolin] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Bioctr, Grosshaderner Str 2, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany; [Haug, Joachim T.; Haug, Carolin] GeoBioctr LMU, Richard Wagner Str 10, D-80333 Munich, Germany","Haug, JT (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Bioctr, Grosshaderner Str 2, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany.; Haug, JT (corresponding author), GeoBioctr LMU, Richard Wagner Str 10, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",joachim.haug@palaeo-evo-devo.info,,,Volkswagen FoundationVolkswagen; LMUexcellent Junior Researcher Fund,The Volkswagen Foundation supports JTH with a Lichtenberg professorship.

The phlebotomine-like features of Eophlebotomus are plesiomorphies mostly also occurring in Sycoracinae, but there are also several synapomorphies supporting a particular relationship between Eophlebotomus and Sycoracinae or Trichomyiinae or both.

Relationships and comparisons of H. scimitarus, H. zigrasi, H. cerberus, and the recently. described Haidomyrmodes mammuthus Perrichot from Cretaceous French amber are also discussed. Haidomyrmex was probably arboreal, cursorial, and a specialized trap-jaw predator, utilizing its enormous mandibles and cranial morphology in concert to capture prey. Mandibles appear to have moved in a plane oblique to the dorsoventral and horizontal axes of the body, unlike the lateral-plane movement of modern ants.

Sucinorhagonycha samsockorum has a few antennomeres that are slightly dentate, making the new species appear intermediate between genus Sucinorhagonycha Kuska, 1996, with filiform antennae, and genus Cacomorphocerus Schaufuss, 1892, which has saucer-shaped central antennomeres. This suggests that the relationship between the two genera may be closer than previously believed.

However, how structures enabling the raptorial function evolved in insects remains largely hypothetical or inferred through phylogeny due to the rarity of meaningful fossils. This is particularly true for mantidflies (Neuroptera: Mantispidae), which have a scarce fossil record mostly based on rock compressions, namely isolated wings. Here, Aragomantispa lacerata gen. et sp. nov. is described from ca. 105-million-year-old San Just amber (Spain), representing the oldest and one of the few mantidflies hitherto described from amber. The fossil shows exquisitely preserved forefemoral spinelike structures composed of integumentary processes each bearing a modified seta, and prostrate setae on foretibiae and foretarsi. The fine morphology of these structures was unknown in fossil mantidflies. An assessment of integumentary specialisations from raptorial forelegs across mantispoid lacewings is provided. The present finding reveals how the specialised foreleg armature associated to the raptorial lifestyle in extant mantidflies was present yet not fully established by the Early Cretaceous, at least in some lineages, and provides palaeontological evidence supporting certain evolutionary patterns of acquisition of integumentary specialisations related to the raptorial function in the group.","[Perez-de la Fuente, Ricardo] Univ Oxford, Museum Nat Hist, Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PW, England; [Penalver, Enrique] Inst Geol & Minero Espana Museo Geominero, C Cirilo Amoros 42, Valencia 46004, Spain","Perez-de la Fuente, R (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Museum Nat Hist, Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PW, England.",ricardo.perez-de-lafuente@oum.ox.ac.uk,,"Perez-de la Fuente, Ricardo/0000-0002-2830-2639; Penalver Molla, Enrique/0000-0001-8312-6087","DGA (Gobierno de Aragon)Gobierno de Aragon; Oxford University Museum of Natural History; Spanish AEI/FEDER, UE [CGL2017-84419]","We thank the Fundacion Conjunto Paleontologico de Teruel-Dinopolis for providing the studied amber sample.

Unusual characters are shortened forewings combined with fully developed, operational hindwings, similar as in Dermaptera, and specialized attachment pads otherwise only found in mantophasmatodeans (heelwalkers). A cladistic analysis suggests a placement as sister to Mantodea, supported by a profemoral brush and other characters. The male genitalia show the same pattern in both groups. Specialized features are the unusual flight apparatus, attachment structures adapted for locomotion on leaves, and a dense profemoral setation suitable for catching small prey. dagger Alienopterus was apparently able to fly and likely a predator of small arthropods in bushes or trees. An impressive radiation of Mantodea started in similar habitats at least 35Ma later in the early Cenozoic. In contrast, dagger Alienopterus was an evolutionary dead end in the roach-mantis transition zone. (C) 2016 International Association for Gondwana Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Several cases of the long-proboscid pollination mode are known between fossil insects (e.g., true flies, scorpionflies, and lacewings) and various extinct gymnosperm lineages, beginning in the Early Permian and increasing during the Middle Jurassic to Early Cretaceous. However, details on the morphology of lacewing proboscides and the relevant pollination habit are largely lacking. Here we report on three lacewing species that belong to two new genera and a described genus from mid-Cretaceous (Albian-Cenomanian) amber of Myanmar. All these species possess relatively long proboscides, which are considered to be modified from maxillary and labial elements, probably functioning as a temporary siphon for feeding on nectar. Remarkably, these proboscides range from 0.4-1.0 mm in length and are attributed to the most diminutive ones among the contemporary long-proboscid insect pollinators. Further, they clearly differ from other long-proboscid lacewings which have a much longer siphon. The phylogenetic analysis indicates that these Burmese long-proboscid lacewings belong to the superfamily Psychopsoidea but cannot be placed into any known family. The present findings represent the first description of the mouthparts of long-proboscid lacewings preserved in amber and highlight the evolutionary diversification of the ancient plant-pollinator interactions.","[Lu, Xiu-Mei; Liu, Xing-Yue] China Agr Univ, Dept Entomol, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Wei-Wei] Three Gorges Entomol Museum, POB 4680, Chongqing 400015, Peoples R China","Liu, XY (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Dept Entomol, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",xingyue_liu@yahoo.com,"Liu, Xingyue/A-3019-2013","Liu, Xingyue/0000-0002-9168-0659; Lu, Xiumei/0000-0002-3494-7871","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31322501, 41271063]",We cordially thank Mrs. Xiao Jia (Kunming) and Mrs. Mo Li (Lijiang) for their generosity in kindly providing the valuable pieces of amber examined in the present study.

Little information is available regarding the origin of scansoriality, which subsequently became widespread and diverse in terms of ecomorphology in this (lade. An undescribed amber fossil (MCZ R-190835) from mid Cretaceous outcrops of the north of Myanmar dated at 99 Ma, previously assigned to stem Gekkota, preserves carpal, metacarpal and phalangeal bones, as well as supplementary climbing structures, such as adhesive pads and paraphalangeal elements. This fossil documents the presence of highly specialized adaptive structures. Here, we analyze in detail the manus of the putative stem Gekkota. We use morphological comparisons in the context of extant squamates, to produce a detailed descriptive analysis and a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) based on 32 skeletal variables of the manus. The comparative sample includes members of 15 extant squamate families (Agamidae, Dactyloidae, lguanidae, Leiosauridae, Liolaemidae, Polychrotidae, Tropiduridae, Diplodactylidae, Eublepharidae, Gekkonidae, Phyllodactylidae, Sphaerodactylidae, Gymnophthalmidae, Teiidae, and Scincidae). Although the fossil manus is qualitatively more similar to that of members of Gekkota, the LDA analysis places it in a morphozone shared by Gekkota and Scincomorpha. This result is particularly interesting, given that despite the presence of paraphalangeal structures had only been reported in extant geckos of the families Gekkonidae and Phyllodactylidae, the usage of an adhesive subdigital system to climb originated independently in Gekkota, Scincidae, and Dactyloidae.

The fossil discussed here has the potential to expand our knowledge of timing, reproductive biology, and paleobiogeography in early angiosperms. METHODS: Cutting-edge methodologies in CT scanning in conjunction with tomography software have opened new possibilities for discovering details in amber-preserved fossils that were inaccessible for meaningful study in the past. KEY RESULTS:The fossil is small and complex, cupulate, with numerous stamens and a suite of characters distributed in the modern families of Laurales. The most parsimonious placement of the fossil based on morphology is as a sister taxon of Atherospermataceae + Gomortega (Gomortegaceae). CONCLUSIONS: This fossil taxon, a Laurasian Lauralean from the mid-Cretaceous, is an important example of fossil Laurales with implications for biogeography and timing in the radiation and extinction in this group.","[Crepet, William L.] Cornell Univ, Sch Integrat Plant Sci, Plant Biol Sect, Mann Lib 412, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Nixon, Kevin C.] Cornell Univ, Sch Integrat Plant Sci, LH Bailey Hortorium, Plant Biol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Grimaldi, David] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Biol, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Riccio, Mark] Cornell Univ, Ctr Biotechnol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Crepet, WL (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Sch Integrat Plant Sci, Plant Biol Sect, Mann Lib 412, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",wlc1@cornell.edu,,,Cornell CALS,"The authors thank Jennifer L.

Using inverted fluorescence and light microscopy for detailed analysis of microstructures, the inclusions were identified as primary larvae of the beetle family Ripiphoridae, subfamily Ripidiinae. While the structure of thoracic and abdominal segments including appendages corresponds well with the groundplan known in recent members of Ripidiinae, a curved prosternal ridge with prominent spines (each c. 5 mu m), the reduced condition of stemmata and antennae and the lack of sharp mandibles are unique features within the entire family, apparently apomorphies of the longipedes larvae. A sinuate prosternal edge with a dense row of spines (prosternoctenidium) might be homologous with 'head ctenidia' in some previously described miniaturized conicocephalate larvae, but further investigation is needed. The morphological differences between the head of longipedes larvae and extant Ripidiinae are interpreted as adaptations to different groups of hosts and life strategies. Palaeoethology of the longipedes larvae is briefly discussed. In addition, the systematic placement of conicocephalate larvae from Canadian, Myanmar and Russian Cretaceous ambers, already interpreted by various authors as primary instars within Coleopterida (assigned to either Strepsiptera or to the coleopteran Tenebrionoidea: Ripiphoridae), is discussed.","[Batelka, Jan; Prokop, Jakub] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, Vinicna 7, Prague 12843 2, Czech Republic; [Pohl, Hans; Beutel, Rolf G.] FSU Jena, Inst Zool & Evolut Forsch, Jena, Germany; [Bai, Ming] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, Beijing, Peoples R China","Prokop, J (corresponding author), Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, Vinicna 7, Prague 12843 2, Czech Republic.",jprokop@natur.cuni.cz,"Pohl, Hans/M-6873-2019; Prokop, Jakub/B-1432-2008","Prokop, Jakub/0000-0001-6996-7832; Pohl, Hans/0000-0002-7090-6612","European Regional Development FundEuropean Commission; state budget of the Czech Republic [CZ.1.05/4.1.00/16.0347]; Grant Agency of the Czech RepublicGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [18-03118S]; Institutional Research Support grant of the Charles University, Prague; Charles University Grant Agency (GAUK) [1546218]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31672345]; Research Equipment Development Project of Chinese Academy of Sciences [YZ201509]","JB and JP are much obliged to Arnold Staniczek and Karin Wolf-Schwenninger (both Staatliches Museum fur Naturkunde, Stuttgart, Germany) for loan of the amber piece with syninclusion of longipedes larvae from Myanmar under their care.

One of the intensely investigated examples of modern parental care are the modern burying beetles (Silphidae: Nicrophorus), a lineage that includes notable endangered species. Here we report diverse transitional silphids from the Mesozoic of China and Myanmar that provide insights into the origins of parental care. Jurassic silphids from Daohugou, sharing many defining characters of Nicrophorinae, primitively lack stridulatory files significant for parental care communications; although morphologically similar, Early Cretaceous nicrophorines from the Jehol biota possess such files, indicating that a system of parental care had evolved by this early date. More importantly, burying beetles of the genus Nicrophorus have their earliest first record in mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber, and document early evolution of elaborate biparental care and defense of small vertebrate carcasses for their larvae. Parental care in the Early Cretaceous may have originated from competition between silphids and their predators. The rise of the Cretaceous Nicrophorinae implies a biology similar to modern counterparts that typically feed on carcasses of small birds and mammals.","[Cai, Chen-Yang; Huang, Di-Ying] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Thayer, Margaret K.; Newton, Alfred F.] Field Museum Nat Hist, Integrat Res Ctr, Chicago, IL 60605 USA; [Engel, Michael S.; Ortega-Blanco, Jaime] Univ Kansas, Museum Nat Hist, Div Entomol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Engel, Michael S.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Wang, Bo] Univ Bonn, Steinmann Inst, D-53115 Bonn, Germany","Huang, DY (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",dyhuang@nigpas.ac.cn,"Engel, Michael S/C-5461-2012","Engel, Michael S/0000-0003-3067-077X","National Basic Research Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2012CB821903]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [91114201, 41222013, J1210006]; Outstanding Youth Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK2012049]; US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0542909]; Alexander von Humboldt FoundationAlexander von Humboldt Foundation","We thank C.

The morphology and occurrence in the fossil record suggests a probable early origin of the family in scale insect evolution. The present phylogenetic analysis based on 69 morphological characters of female ortheziids, using 39 exemplar Recent species provides the first analytical assessment of relationships among living genera of the family, as well as the relationships of eight fossil species, based on complete, well-preserved specimens in amber. Monophyly of the subfamilies Newsteadiinae, Ortheziinae and Ortheziolinae is supported, but Nipponortheziinae is found to be paraphyletic by inclusion of the Ortheziolinae. Thus, the subfamily Ortheziolinae is reduced in rank to tribe Ortheziolini stat.n., which now includes Matileortheziola Kozar & Foldi, Ortheziolacoccus Kozar, Ortheziolamameti Kozar and OrtheziolaSulc. Consequently, the tribes Matileortheziolini, Ortheziolacoccini and Ortheziolamametini are synonymized (syn.n.) here under Ortheziolini. Five new species and one new genus of fossil ensign scales are described from three amber deposits: Burmortheziagen.n. with type species Burmorthezia kotejaisp.n. and also B. insolitasp.n., both in mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber (98 Ma) and Arctorthezia balticasp.n. in Eocene Baltic amber (c. 43 Ma) based on second-instar nymphs; Mixorthezia kozarisp.n. and M. dominicanasp.n. in Miocene Dominican amber (c. 17 Ma) based on adult females.

Yet, eusociality also fostered the evolution of social parasitism-an adverse symbiosis, in which the superorganismal colonies formed by these insects are infiltrated by a profusion of invertebrate species that target nest resources. Predominant among these are the aleocharine rove beetles (Staphylinidae), a vast and ecologically diverse subfamily with numerous morphologically and behaviourally specialized socially parasitic lineages. Here, we report a fossil aleocharine, Mesosymbion compactus gen. et sp. nov., in Burmese amber (similar to 99 million years old), displaying specialized anatomy that is a hallmark of social parasites. Mesosymbion coexisted in the Burmese palaeofauna with stem-group ants and termites that provide the earliest indications of eusociality in both insect groups. We infer that the advent of eusociality led automatically and unavoidably to selection for social parasitism. The antiquity and adaptive flexibility of aleocharines made them among the first organisms to engage in this type of symbiosis.","[Yamamoto, Shuhei] Kyushu Univ, Grad Sch Bioresource & Bioenvironm Sci, Entomol Lab, Higashi Ku, Hakozaki 6-10-1, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan; [Maruyama, Munetoshi] Kyushu Univ Museum, Higashi Ku, Hakozaki 6-10-1, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan; [Parker, Joseph] Columbia Univ, Dept Genet & Dev, 701 West 168th St, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Parker, Joseph] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, New York, NY 10024 USA","Parker, J (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Genet & Dev, 701 West 168th St, New York, NY 10032 USA.; Parker, J (corresponding author), Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, New York, NY 10024 USA.",jp2488@columbia.edu,"Yamamoto, Shuhei/U-8247-2018","Yamamoto, Shuhei/0000-0002-4162-8457","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JapanMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [14J02669]; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [RO1 GM113000]; Ellison Medical FoundationLawrence Ellison Foundation; Sir Henry Wellcome Postdoctoral Fellowship; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF GENERAL MEDICAL SCIENCESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) [R01GM113000] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We thank Yui Takahashi (University of Tsukuba) for preparing the Mesosymbion specimen and David Grimaldi (AMNH) for the providing the accession number of the holotype for deposition.

The species possesses a number of morphological traits that exclude it from all extant suborders, and Burmanopetalidea suborder nov. and Burmanopetalidae fam. nov. are here erected to accommodate it. The new suborder can be recognized by the following unique characters: pleurotergal setae absent; telson with a specific spatulate shape twice the size of the penultimate body ring; hypoproct devoid of setae; and eyes composed of five well-separated ommatidia. While the callipodidan habitus seems to have remained generally unchanged for at least 99 million years, pleurotergal and hypoproctal setation, as well as the complexity of eyes in ground-dwelling forms may have evolved recently in the order. As B. inexpectatum gen. nov. et sp. nov. is the first true callipodidan in the fossil record, the minimum age of Callipodida is thus at least 99 Mya.","[Stoev, Pavel] Natl Museum Nat Hist, Tsar Osvoboditel Blvd 1, Sofia 1000, Bulgaria; [Stoev, Pavel] Pensoft Publishers, Sofia, Bulgaria; [Moritz, Leif; Wesener, Thomas] Leibniz Inst Anim Biodivers, Zool Res Museum Alexander Koenig ZFMK, Adenauerallee 160, D-53113 Bonn, Germany","Stoev, P (corresponding author), Natl Museum Nat Hist, Tsar Osvoboditel Blvd 1, Sofia 1000, Bulgaria.; Stoev, P (corresponding author), Pensoft Publishers, Sofia, Bulgaria.",projects@pensoft.net,"Moritz, Leif/AAF-9547-2020; Stoev, Pavel/H-5112-2019","Moritz, Leif/0000-0002-6028-5189; Stoev, Pavel/0000-0002-5702-5677","Alexander Koenig Stiftung (AKS); National Science Fund, Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Bulgaria [KP-06-H21/1-17.12.2018]; German Science Foundation (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [WE2479/4-1]","We sincerely thank Mr P.

Arthropod bearing Cretaceous resin sites are reviewed, and a list of arthropod records (identified to the family level) published up to 2015 is provided. Also, new records of mites, and new arthropod records from the Siberian resins are given. An efficient method for extracting amber from loose sediments in situations of limited infrastructure but easy access to water is described as well. The sequence of arthropod assemblages in Cretaceous resins according to their evolutionary aspect does not match their geological sequence. This can be only partly explained by taphonomic constraints and inadequacy of the material: there is a deeper difference between somewhat contemporary assemblages than was characteristic of Permian assemblages studied in a similar way in previous studies. Our results confirm the earlier hypothesis that the Palaeozoic-Mesozoic biotic crisis was not so much a mass extinction as a biotic reorganisation that opened the way to diversification. These results might indicate a peculiar feature of the immediate effects of such reorganisations, namely that Mesozoic-Cenozoic communities became differentiated in their compositions much deeper than Palaeozoic ones (i.e., that their constituent groups acquired the ability to evolve much deeper changes while adapting to the ecological specifics of their environments). A transformation of organisms and/or their communities took place, comparable in scope to the rise of skeletal fauna in the Cambrian. The difference between these two transformations is that the later one resulted not from a particular adaptation (the skeleton) but from the ability to specialize more deeply than was possible in the Palaeozoic.

Our cladistic analysis integrating extant and extinct taxa resolves the fossils as both stem-and crown-groups. Similarities between extinct and extant species permit inferences of larval ethology of the fossil species through statistical correlation analyses with high support, implying that morphological disparity matched behavioural diversity.

Details of their origins remain obscure, with little knowledge of their stem group and few insights into the sequence of character acquisition during spider evolution. Here, we describe Chimerarachne yingi gen. et sp. nov., a remarkable arachnid from the mid-Cretaceous (approximately 100 million years ago) Burmese amber of Myanmar, which documents a key transition stage in spider evolution. Like uraraneids, the two fossils available retain a segmented opisthosoma bearing a whip-like telson, but also preserve two traditional synapomorphies for Araneae: a male pedipalp modified for sperm transfer and well-defined spinnerets resembling those of modern mesothele spiders. This unique character combination resolves C. yingi within a Glade including both Araneae and Uraraneida; however, its exact position relative to these orders is sensitive to different parameters of our phylogenetic analysis. Our new fossil most likely represents the earliest branch of the Araneae, and implies that there was a lineage of tailed spiders that presumably originated in the Palaeozoic and survived at least into the Cretaceous of Southeast Asia.","[Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Dunlop, Jason A.] Humboldt Univ, Leibniz Inst Res Evolut & Biodivers, Museum Nat Unde, Berlin, Germany; [Selden, Paul A.] Univ Kansas, Dept Geol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Selden, Paul A.; Garwood, Russell J.] Nat Hist Museum, Earth Sci Dept, London, England; [Garwood, Russell J.] Univ Manchester, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Shear, William A.] Hampden Sydney Coll, Dept Biol, Hampden Sydney, VA 23943 USA; [Mueller, Patrick] Friedhofstr 9, Kashofen, Germany; [Lei, Xiaojie] Univ Sci & Technol China, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China","Wang, B (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Wang, B (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, Beijing, Peoples R China.",bowang@nigpas.ac.cn,"Selden, Paul/C-7530-2009; Dunlop, Jason A./AAC-8042-2019","Selden, Paul/0000-0001-7454-4260; ","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41572010, 41622201, 41688103]; Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDPB05]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [2011224]","We are grateful to M.

In the most derived societies, these divisions are essentially fixed and in some arthropods, include further specialization-a tripartite system with a soldier caste that defends the colony [1]. Eusociality has originated numerous times among insects but is believed to have appeared first in the termites (Isoptera), in the Early Cretaceous [4]. However, all termites known from the Cretaceous have, until now, only been winged reproductives (alates and dealates); the earliest soldiers and definitive workers were known from just the Miocene (ca. 17-20 million years ago [mya]) [4]. Here, we report six termite species preserved in Early Cretaceous (ca. 100 mya) amber from Myanmar, one described as Krishna-termes yoddha gen. et sp. nov., comprising the worker/pseudergate, winged reproductive, and soldier, and a second species, Gigantotermes rex gen. et sp. nov., based on one of the largest soldier termites yet known. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Krishnatermes are in the basal Meiatermesgrade'' of Cretaceous termites. Workers/pseudergates of another four species are briefly described, but not named. One of these workers/pseudergates reveals that ants-the most serious enemies of modern termites-lived in close proximity to termites in the Burmese paleofauna. These discoveries demonstrate the Mesozoic antiquity of specialized termite caste systems and corroborate that among all social species, termites probably had the original societies.","[Engel, Michael S.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Engel, Michael S.] Univ Kansas, Div Entomol, Nat Hist Museum, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Engel, Michael S.; Barden, Phillip; Grimaldi, David A.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Barden, Phillip] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Newark, NJ 07102 USA; [Riccio, Mark L.] Cornell Univ, Inst Biotechnol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA","Engel, MS (corresponding author), Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.; Engel, MS (corresponding author), Univ Kansas, Div Entomol, Nat Hist Museum, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.; Engel, MS; Grimaldi, DA (corresponding author), Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, New York, NY 10024 USA.",msengel@ku.edu; grimaldi@amnh.org,"Engel, Michael S/C-5461-2012","Engel, Michael S/0000-0003-3067-077X; Barden, Phillip/0000-0001-6277-320X","U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0542909, DEB-1144162, DDIG-1313547]; NSF Predoctoral FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF); College of Liberal Arts & Sciences (University of Kansas) Travel Award","We are grateful to James S.

A key dimension of pollination niches refers to the insect proboscis length that commonly matches the floral tube length. Here we describe new kalligrammatid lacewings (an iconic Mesozoic pollinating insect lineage) from late Cretaceous Burmese amber and Mesozoic sediments in China. Kalligrammatids display complex configurations of elongate mouthpart elements consisting of well-developed maxillae, labium and their palps. The mouthpart lengths vary among species, from 0.6 to 18.0 mm, suggesting corresponding variability in the floral tube lengths of Mesozoic plants. With the diversification of pollinating habits, the kalligrammatids presented highly divergent traits related to chemical communication and defence mechanisms. Together with other Mesozoic long-proboscid insects, these fossils not only reveal the high niche diversity of Mesozoic pollinating insects but also highlight the diversity of Mesozoic pollinator-dependent plants prior to the rise of angiosperms.","[Liu, Qing; Zhang, Qingqing; Chen, Jun; Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Lu, Xiumei; Liu, Xingyue] China Agr Univ, Dept Entomol, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Chen, Jun; Zheng, Xiaoting] Linyi Univ, Inst Geol & Paleontol, Linyi 276000, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Weiwei] Three Gorges Entomol Museum, POB 4680400015, Chongqing, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Wang, B (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Liu, XY (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Dept Entomol, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.; Wang, B (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",liuxingyue@cau.edu.cn; bowang@nigpas.ac.cn,"Liu, Xingyue/A-3019-2013","Liu, Xingyue/0000-0002-9168-0659; Lu, Xiumei/0000-0002-3494-7871","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41572010, 31672322, 41622201, 41688103, 31322051]; Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB26000000]","We are grateful to M.S.

A data set of 70 morphological characters scored for 29 species of Mastigitae was analysed using maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference; both analyses recovered a sister relationship between dagger Archemastax and extant leptomastacines. However, in the former analysis Leptomastacini was recovered as sister to the remaining Mastigitae, while the latter indicated an origin of Leptomastacini from within Clidicini.

Surprisingly, direct fossil evidence crucial for elucidating the origin and early evolution of Scydmaenini is lacking. This gap of knowledge is of particular interest as the Cretaceous origin of other major scydmaenine lineages, e.g., Mastigini, Eutheiini, Cephenniini, and Clandulariini, were recently documented. Here, we report a new genus and species, Kuaju borealis gen. et sp. nov., from Cretaceous Burmese amber, pushing back the oldest definitive record of stem-group Scydmaenini to approximately 99 Ma. An affinity of the new taxon with recent Scydmaenini is strongly supported by the beetle's short, dome-like terminal (fourth) maxillary palpomeres, as well as an exposed metanepimera which are typical character states of the tribe. However, Kuafu possesses a plesiomorphic un-notched anterior margin of the scape, a character state unknown among living Scydmaenini, and suggesting a basal position of the fossil taxon. Our find provides firm evidence that stem-group Scydmaenini, like other major scydmaenine lineages, originated no later than the mid-Cretaceous, removing the possibility that Scydmaenini may had a young, Quaternary origin.

The Burma Terrane was part of a Trans-Tethyan island arc and stood at a near-equatorial southern latitude at similar to 95 Ma, suggesting island endemism for the Burmese amber biota. The Burma Terrane underwent significant clockwise rotation between similar to 80 and 50 Ma, causing its subduction margin to become hyper-oblique. Subsequently, it was translated northward on the Indian Plate by an exceptional distance of at least 2,000 km along a dextral strike-slip fault system in the east.

Whether parasitism developed at an early or late stage in the evolution of the group was unknown. Here we record and describe the first definite Mesozoic strepsipteran primary larva embedded in Burmese amber (similar to 99 million years ago). This extends the origin of parasitism back by at least similar to 50 million years, and reveals that this specialized life style has evolved in the Mesozoic or even earlier in the group. The extremely small first instar displays all diagnostic characters of strepsipteran immatures of this stage and is nearly identical with those of Mengenillidae, one of the most ancestral extant strepsipteran taxa. This demonstrates a remarkable evolutionary stasis over 100 million years. The new finding strongly weakens the case of small larvae embedded in Cretaceous amber interpreted as strepsipteran immatures. They differ in many structural features from extant strepsipteran primary larvae and are very likely parasitic beetle larvae.","[Pohl, Hans; Yavorskaya, Margarita I.; Beutel, Rolf G.] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Spezielle Zool & Entomol, Inst Zool & Evolut Forsch, Jena, Germany; [Batelka, Jan; Prokop, Jakub] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, Prague, Czech Republic","Pohl, H (corresponding author), Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Spezielle Zool & Entomol, Inst Zool & Evolut Forsch, Jena, Germany.",hans.pohl@uni-jena.de,"Pohl, Hans/M-6873-2019; Prokop, Jakub/B-1432-2008","Prokop, Jakub/0000-0001-6996-7832; Pohl, Hans/0000-0002-7090-6612","European Regional Development FundEuropean Commission; state budget of the Czech Republic [CZ.1.05/4.1.00/16.0347]; Institutional Research Support grant of the Charles University, Prague; SVV [260 434/2018]; Charles University Grant Agency (GAUK) [1546218]","The publication is co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund and the state budget of the Czech Republic (project No. CZ.1.05/4.1.00/16.0347).

One of the main contributors to their evolutionary success is the elytra, or hardened forewings, which have protective functions while maintaining their ability to fly. Unlike other beetles, some ship-timber beetles (Lymexylidae) have extremely small elytra and largely exposed functional hindwings. There is little fossil evidence illuminating the evolutionary history of short elytra in lymexylids. Here, I report five well-preserved lymexylid fossils in mid-Cretaceous and Cenozoic ambers from Myanmar (ca. 99 million years ago [Mya]), Russia (ca. 44 Mya), and the Dominican Republic (ca. 16 Mya). Three Cretaceous fossils have strongly reduced, shortened elytra, with unexpected variation in elytral size and shape, whereas very small, modified elytra are found only in much younger Dominican amber. These morphologically diverse extinct lymexylids shed new light on the early origin and evolutionary history of elytra reduction and its diverse variation in the ship-timber beetles. Based on the striking morphological similarities with extant lymexylids, these extinct taxa might have had the same, or similar, ecological, behavioural, and flight modes as the extant ship-timber beetles.","[yamamoto, Shuhei] Field Museum Nat Hist, Integrat Res Ctr, 1400S Lake Shore Dr, Chicago, IL 60605 USA","yamamoto, S (corresponding author), Field Museum Nat Hist, Integrat Res Ctr, 1400S Lake Shore Dr, Chicago, IL 60605 USA.",s.yamamoto.64@gmail.com,"Yamamoto, Shuhei/U-8247-2018","Yamamoto, Shuhei/0000-0002-4162-8457","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (Tokyo, Japan) Overseas Research FellowshipMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [29-212]","Thanks are due to Crystal A.

We describe a fossil beetle in 99-million-year-old Burmese amber that we infer to have been a social impostor of the earliest-known ant colonies. Promyrmister kistneri gen. et sp. nov. belongs to the haeteriine clown beetles (Coleoptera: Histeridae), a major Glade of 'myrmecophiles'-specialized nest intruders with dramatic anatomical, chemical and behavioral adaptations for colony infiltration. Promyrmister reveals that myrmecophiles evolved close to the emergence of ant eusociality, in colonies of stem-group ants that predominate Burmese amber, or with cryptic crown-group ants that remain largely unknown at this time. The clown beetle-ant relationship has been maintained ever since by the beetles host-switching to numerous modern ant genera, ultimately diversifying into one of the largest radiations of symbiotic animals. We infer that obligate behavioral symbioses can evolve relatively rapidly, and be sustained over deep time.","[Zhou, Yu-Lingzi] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Yu-Lingzi; Slipinski, Adam] CSIRO, Australian Natl Insect Collect, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Ren, Dong] Capital Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Parker, Joseph] CALTECH, Div Biol & Biol Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA","Parker, J (corresponding author), CALTECH, Div Biol & Biol Engn, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA.",joep@caltech.edu,"Slipinski, Adam/AAZ-2485-2020","Slipinski, Adam/0000-0002-1216-8068; Parker, Joseph/0000-0001-9598-2454",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31402008]; International Postdoctoral Exchange Fellowship [20150064]; Rita Allen Foundation; Esther A. and Joseph Klingenstein Fund; Shurl & Kay Curci Foundation; Simons Foundation,National Natural Science Foundation of China 31402008 Yu-Lingzi Zhou; International Postdoctoral Exchange Fellowship 20150064 Yu-Lingzi Zhou; Rita Allen Foundation Joseph Parker; Esther A. and Joseph Klingenstein Fund Joseph Parker; Shurl & Kay Curci Foundation Joseph Parker; Simons Foundation Joseph Parker,,63,7,9,2,5,ELIFE SCIENCES PUBLICATIONS LTD,CAMBRIDGE,"SHERATON HOUSE, CASTLE PARK, CAMBRIDGE, CB3 0AX, ENGLAND",2050-084X,,,ELIFE,eLife,APR 16,2019,8,,,,,,,,e44985,10.7554/eLife.44985,,,14,Biology,Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics,HT9WT,WOS:000464924100001,30990167,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published, Green Accepted",,,2021-07-18

The recent article by Szadziewski et al. (2016) proposing that Protoculicoides and Atriculicoides are congeneric is shown to be inaccurate. At least three separate lineages are represented by species in these two genera, requiring a new genus, Gerontodacus (type species, G. succineus (Szadziewski)), to include some of them. Archiculicoides, Protoculicoides, Gerontodacus, Adelohelea Borkent and Alautunmyia Borkent remain undetermined to subfamily.

We report living amphibiotic cockroaches from tropical streams of UNESCO BR Sumaco, Ecuador. We also describe the first fossil aquatic roach larvae (6 spp.: n = 44, 1, 1. 1, 1, 1) from the most diverse tropical Mesozoic sediments (Middle Jurassic Bakhar Fm in Mongolia, Kimmeridgian Karabastau Fm in Kazakhstan; Aptian Crato Fm in Brazil), and the Barremian Lebanese and Cenomanian Myanmar ambers. Tropic-limited occurrences are trophic- (biomass/litter-fall), structural- (diversity) and also abiotic-factor-dependent (high temperatures). Diverse Paleozoic aquatic eoblattids are here (re)described from the lower Permian sediments of Elmo, U.S.A. and Chekarda, Russia. They competed with true cockroaches to reach water prior to the Mesozoic. Due to different evolutionary rates or periodical changes in water characteristics, non-adapted terrestrial insects repeatedly invaded the aquatic realm with well adapted hydrobionts. Obscurely. most aquatic lineages still survive. In contrast with Crustacea, aquatic-terrestrial reversal is absent. A single principal lineage, namely of moths, ancestral to butterflies (origination of modern insects from ephemerans and dragonflies is questioned), possibly evolved from insects with aquatic immature stages, and none from aquatic adults. The rest of the orders are terrestrial-derived. The proposed reason for the lack of land return is the character of numerous aquatic adaptations related to reductions, which are unlikely to be resuppressed. The aquatic insect family/terrestrial insect family ratio over time reveals a sharp rise from the Late Carboniferous to Late Triassic followed by lasting stability. Diversification of aquatic insects seems consistent with a 62.05 + 0.02 Ma periodicity. (C) 2018 International Association for Gondwana Research. Published by Elsevier B.V.

A new specimen of an unnamed species of dagger Nuegua Yin et al. is recorded from the same deposit and illustrated for comparative purposes. dagger Loeblitoides is morphologically close to dagger Pangusyndicus, but has more plesiomorphic antennae, with the antennomere 11 distinctly smaller than 10, but fully demarcated by a constriction (antennomere 10 is not subcylindrical as in dagger Pangusyndicus, but fusiform). dagger Pangusyndicus longirostris, in turn, is unusual in having an elongated pre-ocular region of the head, resembling the condition known so far only in dagger Nuegua. Morphological affinities between these genera strongly suggest their close relationships. The previously postulated hypothesis of a close relationship between dagger Pangusyndicus and the extant Syndicus (and its closest relatives) is discussed as poorly supported, as these taxa, despite having similar antennal structure, differ in many important characters. In order to verify this issue, much dense taxon sampling (i.e., inclusion of at least most of extant genera and subgenera of Glandulariini) is required, as this is the largest and taxonomically most challenging tribe of Scydmaeninae, with still largely unknown relationships between extant taxa.

This investigation is the first cladistic analysis to use more than fourfold as many characters as any prior study, and a broader sampling of taxa. The analysis of 189 morphological characters of all stages of representatives of all extant strepsipteran families and characters of adult males of amber fossils results in the following branching pattern: (dagger Protoxenos + (dagger Cretostylops + (dagger Mengea + (Mengenillidae + (Corioxenidae + (Bohartillidae + (Halictophagidae + (Elenchidae + (dagger Protelencholax + (Myrmecolacidae + (Callipharixenidae + (Xenidae + Stylopidae)))))))))))). The basal placement of the Baltic amber fossil dagger Protoxenos and the Burmese amber fossil dagger Cretostylops is well founded. Even though dagger Cretostylops is older than dagger Protoxenos it is almost certainly not the most basal strepsipteran group but the sister group of a clade comprising the Baltic amber fossil dagger Mengea + Strepsiptera s. str. (excl. stemlineage). Monophyly of Mengenillidae, Stylopidia, Stylopiformia s.l., Corioxenidae, Xenidae, and Stylopidae is confirmed. Mengenillidia is paraphyletic (with respect to dagger Mengea (Mengeidae)), Elenchidae (with respect to dagger Protelencholax) and the genus Stichotrema (with respect to the Baltic amber fossils). Thus Protelencholacidae fam. n. is described, and S. weitschati and S. triangulum are transferred to Palaeomyrmecolax. A ground plan of adult male Strepsiptera is provided and evolutionary interpretations are presented based on the obtained cladograms.

The new coreid, with elaborately formed antennae and simple hind legs instead of the typical extant coreid morphology with simple antennae and elaborately formed hind legs, begs the question: why were the elaborate features of the antennae lost in favor of ornate hind legs? Features that are large and showy are at higher risk of being attacked by predators or stuck in a poor molt and subjected to autotomy and are therefore lost at a higher rate than simple appendages. We hypothesize that because elaborate antennae play an additional significant sensory role compared to elaborate hind legs, that evolutionarily it is more costly to have elaborate antennae versus elaborate hind legs. Thus, through the millenia, as coreid evolution experimented with elaborate/ornate features, those on the antennae were likely selected against in favor of ornate hind legs.","[Cumming, Royce T. .; Le Tirant, Stephane] Montreal Insectarium, 4581 Rue Sherbrooke Est, Montreal, PQ H1X 2B2, Canada; [Cumming, Royce T. .] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Richard Gilder Grad Sch, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Cumming, Royce T. .] CUNY, Grad Ctr, Biol, New York, NY 10010 USA","Cumming, RT (corresponding author), Montreal Insectarium, 4581 Rue Sherbrooke Est, Montreal, PQ H1X 2B2, Canada.; Cumming, RT (corresponding author), Amer Museum Nat Hist, Richard Gilder Grad Sch, New York, NY 10024 USA.; Cumming, RT (corresponding author), CUNY, Grad Ctr, Biol, New York, NY 10010 USA.",phylliidae.walkingleaf@gmail.com,,"Cumming, Royce T./0000-0001-7930-1292",,,,34,0,0,0,0,PENSOFT PUBLISHERS,SOFIA,"12 PROF GEORGI ZLATARSKI ST, SOFIA, 1700, BULGARIA",1313-2989,1313-2970,,ZOOKEYS,ZooKeys,JUN 11,2021,,1043,,,,,117,131,,10.3897/zookeys.1043.67730,,,15,Zoology,Zoology,SV9NV,WOS:000664146000005,34163298,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2021-07-18

A dataset of 76 morphological characters scored for 33 recent species across the subfamilies Staphylininae and Paederinae was analysed using maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference methods. The many differing phylogenetic hypotheses for higher-level relationships in the large rove beetle subfamilies Staphylininae and Paederinae were summarized and their hitherto known fossil record was reviewed. Based on the analyses, the new extinct genus Vetatrecus gen.n. is described with two new species: V. adelfiae sp.n. and V. secretum sp.n. Both species share character states that easily distinguish them from all recent Othiini and demonstrate a missing morphological link between subfamilies Staphylininae and Paederinae. This is the first morphology-based evidence for the paraphyly of Staphylininae with respect to Paederinae, suggested earlier by two independent molecular-based phylogenies of recent taxa. Our newly discovered stem lineage of Othiini stresses the importance of fossils in phylogenetic analyses conducted with the aim of improving the natural classification of extant species. It also suggests that the definitions of Staphylininae and Paederinae, long-established family-group taxa, may have to be reconsidered.","[Kypke, Janina L.; Solodovnikov, Alexey; Zyla, Dagmara] Nat Hist Museum Denmark, Biosystemat Sect, Zool Museum, Univ Pk 15, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Brunke, Adam] Agr & Agri Food Canada, Canadian Natl Collect Insects Arachnids & Nematod, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Yamamoto, Shuhei] Kyushu Univ Museum, Fukuoka, Fukuoka, Japan; [Yamamoto, Shuhei] Field Museum Nat Hist, Integrat Res Ctr, Chicago, IL 60605 USA","Kypke, JL (corresponding author), Nat Hist Museum Denmark, Biosystemat Sect, Zool Museum, Univ Pk 15, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.",j.kypke@snm.ku.dk,"Yamamoto, Shuhei/U-8247-2018; Solodovnikov, Alexey/A-2298-2012","Yamamoto, Shuhei/0000-0002-4162-8457; Zyla, Dagmara/0000-0003-4959-763X; Solodovnikov, Alexey/0000-0003-2031-849X; Kypke, Janina/0000-0003-2120-3133",Villum Foundation; European UnionEuropean Commission [642241],"We are very thankful to Anders Leth Damgaard (Copenhagen, Denmark) for providing one of the fossils, Yui Takahashi (University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan) for preparing the amber specimens used in this study, Aslak Kappel Hansen for some illustrations, and Arn Rytter Jensen for the digital artistic reconstruction of Vetatrecus secretum.

These arachnids have a long evolutionary history but their origins and phylogenetic affinities are still being debated. Here, we summarise their fossil record based on a comprehensive review of the literature and data contained in other sources. Pseudoscorpions are one of the oldest colonisers of the land, with fossils known since the Middle Devonian (ca. 390 Ma). The only arachnid orders with an older fossil record are scorpions, harvestmen and acariform mites, plus two extinct groups. Pseudoscorpions do not fossilise easily, and records from the Mesozoic and Cenozoic consist almost exclusively of amber inclusions. Most Mesozoic fossils come from Archingeay and Burmese ambers (Late Cretaceous) and those from the Cenozoic are primarily from Eocene Baltic amber, although additional fossils from, for example, Miocene Dominican and Mexican ambers, are known. Overall, 16 of the 26 families of living pseudoscorpions have been documented from fossils and 49 currently valid species are recognised in the literature. Pseudoscorpions represent a case of morphological stasis and even the Devonian fossils look rather modern. Indeed, most amber fossils are comparable to Recent groups despite a major gap in the fossil record of almost 250 Myr. Baltic amber inclusions indicate palaeofauna inhabiting much warmer climates than today and point to climatic shifts in central Europe since the Eocene. They also indicate that some groups (e.g. Feaellidae and Pseudogarypidae) had much wider Eocene distributions. Their present-day occurrence is relictual and highlights past extinction events. Faunas from younger tropical amber deposits (e.g. Dominican and Mexican amber) are comparable to Recent ones. Generally, there is a strong bias in the amber record towards groups that live under tree bark, whereas those from litter habitats are underrepresented. We also discuss challenges in interpreting fossils: their cryptic morphology warranting novel techniques of morphological reconstruction, the massive gap in the fossil record between the Palaeozoic and Mesozoic, and problems with the classification of (historically) old amber material. Finally, we discuss aspects of the palaeoecology and biology of the fossils compared with the Recent fauna, such as phoresy.","[Harms, Danilo] Univ Hamburg, Ctr Nat Hist, Zool Museum, Martin Luther King Pl 3, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Dunlop, Jason A.] Museum Nat Kunde, Leibniz Inst Evolut & Biodivers Sci, Invalidenstr 43, D-10115 Berlin, Germany","Harms, D (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Ctr Nat Hist, Zool Museum, Martin Luther King Pl 3, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",danilo.harms@uni-hamburg.de,"Dunlop, Jason A./AAC-8042-2019",,,,,134,18,20,0,24,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",2193-0066,1860-1014,,FOSS REC,Foss.

One obstacle hindering studies of myxomycete evolution is that their fossils are exceedingly rare, so evolutionary analyses of this supposedly ancient lineage of amoebozoans are restricted to extant taxa. Molecular data have significantly advanced myxomycete systematics, but the evolutionary history of individual lineages and their ecological adaptations remain unknown. Here, we report exquisitely preserved myxomycete sporocarps in amber from Myanmar, ca. 100 million years old, one of the few fossil myxomycetes, and the only definitive Mesozoic one. Six densely-arranged stalked sporocarps were engulfed in tree resin while young, with almost the entire spore mass still inside the sporotheca. All morphological features are indistinguishable from those of the modern, cosmopolitan genus Stemonitis, demonstrating that sporocarp morphology has been static since at least the mid-Cretaceous. The ability of myxomycetes to develop into dormant stages, which can last years, may account for the phenotypic stasis between living Stemonitis species and this fossil one, similar to the situation found in other organisms that have cryptobiosis. We also interpret Stemonitis morphological stasis as evidence of strong environmental selection favouring the maintenance of adaptations that promote wind dispersal.","[Rikkinen, Jouko] Univ Helsinki, Finnish Museum Nat Hist, POB 7, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Rikkinen, Jouko] Univ Helsinki, Fac Biol & Environm Sci, Organismal & Evolutionary Biol Res Programme, POB 65, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland; [Grimaldi, David A.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Schmidt, Alexander R.] Univ Gottingen, Dept Geobiol, Goldschmidtstr 3, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany","Rikkinen, J (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Finnish Museum Nat Hist, POB 7, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.; Rikkinen, J (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Fac Biol & Environm Sci, Organismal & Evolutionary Biol Res Programme, POB 65, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.; Schmidt, AR (corresponding author), Univ Gottingen, Dept Geobiol, Goldschmidtstr 3, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany.",jouko.rikkinen@helsinki.fi; alexander.schmidt@geo.uni-goettingen.de,"Rikkinen, Jouko/AAM-8732-2021","Rikkinen, Jouko/0000-0002-4615-6639",German Research FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG); Open Access Publication Funds of the University of Gottingen,We thank James Zigras for providing the amber specimen to the American Museum of Natural History for research.

The clypeus, highly modified as in other closely related haidomyrmecine hell ants, is equipped with a paddle-like projection similar to Ceratomyrmex. X-ray imaging reveals that this clypeal paddle is reinforced, most probably with sequestered metals. Presumably this fortified clypeal structure was utilized in tandem with scythe-like mandibles to pin and potentially puncture soft-bodied prey.

However, its phylogeny and evolution of mouthparts among other issues remain debatable. Here new methods of preparation permitted the comprehensive anatomical description of insect inclusions from mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber in astonishing detail. These missing links fossils, attributed to a new order Permopsocida, provide crucial evidence for reconstructing the phylogenetic relationships in the Acercaria, supporting its monophyly, and questioning the position of Psocodea as sister group of holometabolans in the most recent phylogenomic study. Permopsocida resolves as sister group of Thripida + Hemiptera and represents an evolutionary link documenting the transition from chewing to piercing mouthparts in relation to suction feeding. Identification of gut contents as angiosperm pollen documents an ecological role of Permopsocida as early pollen feeders with relatively unspecialized mouthparts. This group existed for 185 million years, but has never been diverse and was superseded by new pollenivorous pollinators during the Cretaceous co-evolution of insects and flowers. The key innovation of suction feeding with piercing mouthparts is identified as main event that triggered the huge post-Carboniferous radiation of hemipterans, and facilitated the spreading of pathogenic vectors.","[Huang, Di-Ying; Cai, Chen-Yang; Ohlhoff, Rainer] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Bechly, Guenter; Staniczek, Arnold H.; Krogmann, Lars] Staatl Museum Nat Kunde Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany; [Nel, Patricia; Garrouste, Romain; Bourgoin, Thierry; Nel, Andre] Museum Natl Hist Nat, Inst Syst Evolut Biodiversite, Paris, France; [Nel, Patricia] AgroParisTech, Paris, France; [Engel, Michael S.] Univ Kansas, Nat Hist Museum, Div Entomol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Engel, Michael S.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Engel, Michael S.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Prokop, Jakub] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, Prague, Czech Republic; [Azar, Dany] Lebanese Univ, Fac Sci 2, Dept Biol, Beirut, Lebanon; [van de Kamp, Thomas; Baumbach, Tilo] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, ANKA Inst Photon Sci & Synchrotron Radiat, Eggenstein Leopoldshafen, Germany; [van de Kamp, Thomas; Baumbach, Tilo] Karlsruhe Inst Technol, Lab Applicat Synchrotron Radiat, Karlsruhe, Germany; [Ohlhoff, Rainer] Konigsfeld 22A, Saarbrucken, Germany; [Shmakov, Alexey S.] Russian Acad Sci, Palaeontol Inst, Arthropoda Lab, Moscow, Russia","Nel, A (corresponding author), Museum Natl Hist Nat, Inst Syst Evolut Biodiversite, Paris, France.",anel@mnhn.fr,"Bourgoin, Thierry/L-5146-2019; Bechly, Gunter/M-6302-2017; dos Santos Rolo, Tomy/F-5511-2016; GARROUSTE, Romain/AAK-3692-2021; Engel, Michael S/C-5461-2012; Prokop, Jakub/B-1432-2008; van de Kamp, Thomas/G-1440-2016; Azar, Dany/AAF-7387-2020; Staniczek, Arnold H./U-9127-2019; Shmakov, Alexey/AAO-4360-2021","Bourgoin, Thierry/0000-0001-9277-2478; Bechly, Gunter/0000-0002-9162-4294; dos Santos Rolo, Tomy/0000-0002-9771-3511; GARROUSTE, Romain/0000-0002-0880-5781; Engel, Michael S/0000-0003-3067-077X; Prokop, Jakub/0000-0001-6996-7832; van de Kamp, Thomas/0000-0001-7390-1318; Azar, Dany/0000-0002-4485-197X; Staniczek, Arnold H./0000-0001-5577-137X; Shmakov, Alexey/0000-0002-9033-384X; Nel, Patricia/0000-0002-7530-5138","National Basic Research Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2012CB821903]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41222013, 91114201]; Outstanding Youth Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK2012049]; Grant Agency of the Czech RepublicGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [14-03847J]; French CNRS-China Academy of Science; Lebanese University","We thank the President and Fellows of Harvard College for permission to use MCZ copyrighted material; the Willi Hennig Society for the use of the TNT software; and the ANKA Synchrotron Radiation Facility for providing beam time.

Complex adaptive mechanisms permit these animals to integrate into societies and to exploit their controlled physical conditions and plentiful resources, as well as to garner protection inside termite nests. An understanding of the early evolution of termitophily is challenging owing to a scarcity of fossil termitophiles, with all known reliable records occurring from the Miocene (approximately 19 million years ago [mya]) [1-6], and an equivocal termitophile belonging to the largely free-living Mesoporini from the mid-Cretaceous [7]. Here we report the oldest, morphologically specialized, and obligate termitophiles from mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber (99 mya). Cretotrichopsenius burmiticus gen. et sp. nov. belongs to Trichopseniini, a group of distinctive termitophilous aleocharine rove beetles, all of which possess specialized swollen or horseshoe-crab-shaped body plans. Cretotrichopsenius display the protective horseshoe-crab-shaped body form typical of many modern termitophiles, with concealed head and antennae and strong posteriorly directed abdominal setae. Cretotrichopsenius represent the earliest definitive termitophiles, shedding light on host associations in the early evolution of termite societies. The fossil reveals that ancient termite societies were quickly invaded by beetles and by multiple independent lineages of social parasites over the subsequent eons.","[Cai, Chenyang] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, Key Lab Econ Stratig & Palaeogeog, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Huang, Diying] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Newton, Alfred F.] Field Museum Nat Hist, Integrat Res Ctr, Chicago, IL 60605 USA; [Eldredge, K.

Among them, the family Aneuretopsychidae is especially important because its mouthparts are vital to deciphering the early evolution of Mesopsychoidea and putatively the origin of fleas (Siphonaptera). However, the identification of mouthpart homologs among Aneuretopsychidae remains controversial because of the lack of three-dimensional anatomical data. Here, we report the first Aneuretopsychidae from Late Cretaceous Burmese amber, which have short maxillary palpi and elongate mouthpart elements consisting of one pair of galeae and one hypopharynx. Their mouthparts are identical to those of Pseudopolycentropodidae (= Dualulidae, new synonym) but are not homologous to those of Siphonaptera. Our phylogenetic analysis provides robust evidence for the debated monophyly of Mesopsychoidea. Our results suggest that the long-proboscid condition has most likely evolved once in Mesopsychoidea, independently from fleas, and further reveal the variety and complexity of mid-Cretaceous pollinating insects.","[Zhao, Xiangdong; Wang, Bo; Aria, Cedric; Zhang, Qingqing; Zhang, Haichun] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Xiangdong; Wang, Bo; Aria, Cedric; Zhang, Qingqing; Zhang, Haichun] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Xiangdong; Zhang, Qingqing] Univ Sci & Technol China, Hefei 230026, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bo] Shandong Univ Sci & Technol, Shandong Prov Key Lab Deposit Mineralizat & Sedim, Qingdao 266590, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Bashkuev, Alexey S.] Russian Acad Sci, Paleontol Inst, Profsoyuznaya Ul 123, Moscow 117997, Russia; [Tang, Wentao] Changzhou Vocat Inst Engn, 3 Gehu Rd, Changzhou 213164, Peoples R China; [Engel, Michael S.] Univ Kansas, Nat Hist Museum, Div Entomol, 1501 Crestline Dr,Suite 140, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Engel, Michael S.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Engel, Michael S.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, New York, NY 10024 USA","Wang, B (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China.; Wang, B (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China.; Wang, B (corresponding author), Shandong Univ Sci & Technol, Shandong Prov Key Lab Deposit Mineralizat & Sedim, Qingdao 266590, Shandong, Peoples R China.",bowang@nigpas.ac.cn,"Engel, Michael S/C-5461-2012; Aria, Cedric/J-4449-2019","Engel, Michael S/0000-0003-3067-077X; Aria, Cedric/0000-0002-0567-1730; Bashkuev, Alexey/0000-0001-7929-8759","Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDA19050101, XDB26000000]; Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research [2019QZKK0706]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41622201, 41688103]; Russian Foundation for Basic ResearchRussian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR) [18-04-00322]","This research was supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDA19050101 and XDB26000000), the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (2019QZKK0706), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41622201 and 41688103), and the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (18-04-00322).",,30,2,6,4,11,AMER ASSOC ADVANCEMENT SCIENCE,WASHINGTON,"1200 NEW YORK AVE, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20005 USA",2375-2548,,,SCI ADV,Sci.

The sooty mould community is a distinctive trophic element of New Zealand forest ecosystems that is driven by plant-feeding sternorrhynchan Hemiptera. These produce honeydew, which supports fungal growth, which in turn supports numerous endemic invertebrates, including endemic New Zealand beetle families. Ancient New Zealand insect fossils are rare but a single fossil of a sooty mould cyclaxyrid was recently described from Cretaceous Burmese amber, a family that was previously known from two extant New Zealand species. Well-preserved fossils like this one are recasting Earth history, and, based on a wealth of additional specimens, we re-evaluate the taxonomy of Cretaceous cyclaxyrids and one Eocene species here transferred to Cyclaxyridae. Cyclaxyridae are highly tied to the sooty mould community and have now been discovered to occur in disparate biogeographic realms in deep time. Our discovery indicates that the family, and perhaps the sooty mould community in general, was widespread in Pangaea from at least the Cretaceous and survived as a relict in New Zealand. Persistence of a sooty mould ecosystem in New Zealand and fungal specialization may not necessarily be an evolutionary 'dead-end' for cyclaxyrids and other insects.","[Gimmel, Matthew L.] Santa Barbara Museum Nat Hist, Invertebrate Zool Dept, 2559 Puesta Sol Rd, Santa Barbara, CA 93105 USA; [Szawaryn, Karol] Polish Acad Sci, Museum & Inst Zool, Wilcza 64, PL-00679 Warsaw, Poland; [Cai, Chenyang] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Cai, Chenyang] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Leschen, Richard A.

Such a phylogenetic relationship agrees with the results from previous molecular phylogeny. Alongside these findings, there are many taxa that can only be shown to be termites with no other phylogenetically informative data. These form a comb of 'grade groups' emerging in the Late Jurassic. The new amber specimens are described as two new species.

These specializations allow for prey to better evade capture or permit predators to more easily approach their prey, or in some cases, the mimesis can serve both purposes. Despite the importance of mimesis and camouflage in predator-avoidance or hunting strategies, the long-term history of these traits is often obscured by an insufficient fossil record. Here, we report the discovery of Upper Cretaceous (approximately 100 million years old) green lacewing larvae (Chrysopoidea), preserved in amber from northern Myanmar, anatomically modified to mimic coeval liverworts. Chrysopidae are a diverse lineage of lacewings whose larvae usually camouflage themselves with a uniquely constructed packet of exogenous debris, conveying greater stealth upon them as they hunt prey such as aphids as well as evade their own predators [3, 4]. However, no lacewing larvae today mimic their surroundings. While the anatomy of Phyllochrysa huangi gen. et sp. nov. allowed it to avoid detection, the lack of setae or other anatomical elements for entangling debris as camouflage means its sole defense was its mimicry, and it could have been a stealthy hunter like living and other fossil Chrysopoidea or been an ambush predator aided by its disguise. The present fossils demonstrate a hitherto unknown life-history strategy among these wolf in sheep's clothing predators, one that apparently evolved from a camouflaging ancestor but did not persist within the lineage.","[Liu, Xingyue; Lu, Xiumei] China Agr Univ, Dept Entomol, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Shi, Gongle; Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Shi, Gongle; Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Xia, Fangyuan] Lingpoge Amber Museum, Nanjiao Bieshu 394, Shanghai 201108, Peoples R China; [Engel, Michael S.] Univ Kansas, Nat Hist Museum, Div Entomol, 1501 Crestline Dr,Suite 140, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Engel, Michael S.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Engel, Michael S.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, Cent Pk West & 79th St, New York, NY 10024 USA","Liu, XY (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Dept Entomol, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.; Wang, B (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Wang, B (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Engel, MS (corresponding author), Univ Kansas, Nat Hist Museum, Div Entomol, 1501 Crestline Dr,Suite 140, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.; Engel, MS (corresponding author), Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.; Engel, MS (corresponding author), Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, Cent Pk West & 79th St, New York, NY 10024 USA.",liuxingyue@cau.edu.cn; bowang@nigpas.ac.cn; msengel@ku.edu,"Shi, Gongle/E-3840-2012; Engel, Michael S/C-5461-2012; Liu, Xingyue/A-3019-2013","Shi, Gongle/0000-0003-3374-6637; Engel, Michael S/0000-0003-3067-077X; Liu, Xingyue/0000-0002-9168-0659; Lu, Xiumei/0000-0002-3494-7871","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31672322, 41622201, 41688103]; Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDPB05]; Beijing Natural Science FoundationBeijing Natural Science Foundation [5162016]; US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1144162]","We are grateful to Jochen Heinrichs for helpful discussion on the leafy liverworts; Jiahui Hu, Song Bai, and Hui Jiang for the help on photographs; and Dinghua Yang for the illustration of ecological reconstruction.

Reproductive health care that includes family planning is of heightened importance in such settings, however, funding and resources tend to be constrained and geared towards acute health services such as trauma management and infectious disease containment. Here we report on the complexities and challenges of providing family planning in a post-emergency refugee setting, using the example of the largest refugee camp on the Thai-Myanmar border, in existence now for over 30 years. Data from 2009 demonstrates an upward trend in uptake of all contraceptives, especially long acting reversible contraception (LARC) and permanent methods (e.g.sterilization) over time. Increased uptake occurred during periods of time when there were boosts in funding or when barriers to access were alleviated. For example a surgeon fluent in local languages is correlated with increased uptake of tubal ligation in females. These data indicate that funding directed toward contraceptives in this refugee setting led to increases in contraceptives use. However, contraceptive uptake estimates depend on the baseline population which is difficult to measure in this setting. As far as we are aware, this is the longest reported review of family planning services for a refugee camp setting to date. The lessons learned from this setting may be valuable given the current global refugee crisis.","[Srikanok, Somjet; Ontuwong, Pranee; Sirinonthachai, Supachai] Planned Parenthood Assoc Thailand, Bangkok, Thailand; [Parker, Daniel M.; Parker, Amber L.; Lee, Tracey; Min, Aung Myat; Tan, Saw Oo; McGready, Rose] Mahidol Univ, Fac Trop Med, Shoklo Malaria Res Unit, Mahidol Oxford Trop Med Res Unit, Mae Sot, Thailand; [McGready, Rose] Univ Oxford, Nuffield Dept Med, Ctr Trop Med & Global Hlth, Old Rd Campus, Oxford, England","Parker, DM (corresponding author), Mahidol Univ, Fac Trop Med, Shoklo Malaria Res Unit, Mahidol Oxford Trop Med Res Unit, Mae Sot, Thailand.",daniel@shoklo-unit.com,"McGready, Rose/A-3290-2014; Parker, Daniel M./B-5471-2013","McGready, Rose/0000-0003-1621-3257; Parker, Daniel M./0000-0002-5352-7338; Parker, Amber/0000-0002-6248-3904",UNHCR; International Planned Parenthood Federation East and South East Asia and Oceania Region (IPPF ESEAOR); Malariadokters (The Netherlands)Netherlands Government; Wellcome TrustWellcome TrustEuropean Commission [WT-106698],"We are grateful for the support received by PPAT under the patronage of H.R.H the Princess Mother, from UNHCR in 2008, and International Planned Parenthood Federation East and South East Asia and Oceania Region (IPPF ESEAOR) in 2009, and Malariadokters (The Netherlands) in 2011.

During entomological field work in rain forests of central Vietnam a new species of Micropterigidae was discovered. It is described herein as Aureopterix bachmaensis sp. nov. based on male and female specimens collected at light in the Bach-Ma National Park. The identification was corroborated by a molecular analysis. This is the first record of this genus in the Northern Hemisphere, previously thought to be restricted to the Australian Region (including New Caledonia). First results of investigations of Burmese amber inclusions now reveal the presence of the Australian Region families Agathiphagidae and Lophocoronidae in the Cretaceous of Asia. The fossil taxon Agathiphagama perdita gen. nov., sp. nov. is established on the basis of two females and this is assigned to Agathiphagidae. The fossil genus Acanthocorona gen. nov. is established in Lophocoronidae and includes seven species described here as A. skalskii sp. nov., A. bowangi sp. nov., A. muelleri sp. nov., A. kuranishii sp. nov., A. sattleri sp. nov., A. spinifera sp. nov. and A. wichardi sp. nov. The new species can be distinguished by the male genitalia which are illustrated together with wing venation and other morphological characters. The disjunct ranges of these taxa are discussed in a historical biogeographic context. Vicariance and dispersal hypotheses explaining the disjunct pattern are discussed. The discovery of these new species suggests a broader ancestral range of Aureopterix, Agathiphagidae and Lophocoronidae. Their extant ranges may be regarded as remnants or relicts of a wider distribution in the Mesozoic, or at least in the case of Aureopterix they could be the results of recent or ancient dispersal processes, since the calibration of molecular splits does not so far accord with plate tectonics.","[Mey, Wolfram; Leger, Theo] Leibniz Inst Evolut & Biodivers Res, Museum Naturkunde, Invalidenstr 43, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Vu Van Lien] Vietnam Natl Museum Nat, Hanoi, Vietnam","Mey, W (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Evolut & Biodivers Res, Museum Naturkunde, Invalidenstr 43, D-10115 Berlin, Germany.",wolfram.mey@mfn.de; Theo.Leger@mfn.berlin; vulien@vnmn.vast.vn,,,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [01 DP17052],"We thank J.

Two other species are placed in the same genus, but they remain unnamed. This is the first known extinct genus of the large tribe Cephenniini that includes cosmopolitan extant ant-like stone beetles with uniquely modified mouthparts adapted to feed on armored mites. dagger Praphennium shares most exoskeletal characters with its extant relatives, and the structure and position of its hypognathous head suggest that the adults were also specialized predators that fed on heavily sclerotized oribatid or uropodine mites. One of the studied specimens seems to be teratological, with a reduced number of antennomeres, representing the first such a case in the fossil record of Scydmaeninae. Together with a previously known Turonian dagger Hyperstenichnus of Glandulariini, the discovery of dagger Praphennium supports early origins of acarophagy among Scydmaeninae, the only group of beetles that have adapted to feeding on this well-protected group of soil arthropods. A preliminary phylogenetic analysis suggests a close relationship between dagger Praphennium and the extant genera Cephennodes and Hlavaciellus, and this Glade might have likely evolved within the Eurasian part of Laurasia.

The fossil records reveal that some flower-visiting groups had diversified during the mid-Cretaceous, consistent with the rise of angiosperms to widespread floristic dominance. These brachyceran groups played an important role in the origin of co-evolutionary relationships with basal angiosperms. Moreover, the rise of angiosperms not only improved the diversity of flower-visiting flies, but also advanced the turnover and evolution of other specialized flies.","[Zhang, Qingqing; Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qingqing] Univ Sci & Technol China, Hefei, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, Beijing, Peoples R China","Wang, B (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Wang, B (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, Beijing, Peoples R China.",bowang@nigpas.ac.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41572010, 41622201, 41688103]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of CAS [2011224]","We thank Xin Wang for inviting us to contribute this review, and two reviewers for reviewing the manuscript and constructive criticisms.

Debris-carrying, a behavior of actively harvesting and carrying exogenous materials, is among the most fascinating and complex behaviors because it requires not only an ability to recognize, collect, and carry materials but also evolutionary adaptations in related morphological characteristics. However, the fossil record of such behavior is extremely scarce, and only a single Mesozoic example from Spanish amber has been recorded; therefore, little is known about the early evolution of this complicated behavior and its underlying anatomy. We report a diverse insect assemblage of exceptionally preserved debris carriers from Cretaceous Burmese, French, and Lebanese ambers, including the earliest known chrysopoid larvae (green lacewings), myrmeleontoid larvae (split-footed lacewings and owlflies), and reduviids (assassin bugs). These ancient insects used a variety of debris material, including insect exoskeletons, sand grains, soil dust, leaf trichomes of gleicheniacean ferns, wood fibers, and other vegetal debris. They convergently evolved their debris-carrying behavior through multiple pathways, which expressed a high degree of evolutionary plasticity. We demonstrate that the behavioral repertoire, which is associated with considerable morphological adaptations, was already widespread among insects by at least the Mid-Cretaceous. Together with the previously known Spanish specimen, these fossils are the oldest direct evidence of camouflaging behavior in the fossil record. Our findings provide a novel insight into early evolution of camouflage in insects and ancient ecological associations among plants and insects.","[Wang, Bo; Shi, Gongle; Zhang, Haichun; Chen, Jun; Jarzembowski, Edmund A.] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bo; Wappler, Torsten; Rust, Jes] Univ Bonn, Steinmann Inst, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Xia, Fangyuan] Nanjiao Bieshu 394, Shanghai 201108, Peoples R China; [Engel, Michael S.] Univ Kansas, Div Entomol, Nat Hist Museum, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Engel, Michael S.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Perrichot, Vincent] Univ Rennes 1, CNRS UMR Geosci 6118, F-35042 Rennes, France; [Perrichot, Vincent] Univ Rennes 1, OSUR, F-35042 Rennes, France; [Chen, Jun] Linyi Univ, Inst Geol & Paleontol, Linyi 276000, Peoples R China; [Jarzembowski, Edmund A.] Nat Hist Museum, Dept Earth Sci, London SW7 5BD, England","Wang, B (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Wang, B (corresponding author), Univ Bonn, Steinmann Inst, D-53115 Bonn, Germany.; Wang, B (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",bowang@nigpas.ac.cn,"Wappler, Torsten/P-6831-2019; Engel, Michael S/C-5461-2012; Shi, Gongle/E-3840-2012; Perrichot, Vincent/I-4134-2019","Wappler, Torsten/0000-0003-1592-0988; Engel, Michael S/0000-0003-3067-077X; Shi, Gongle/0000-0003-3374-6637; Perrichot, Vincent/0000-0002-7973-0430",National Basic Research Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2012CB821900]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41572010]; Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) President's International Fellowship Initiative [2011t2z04]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of CAS [2011224]; Alexander von Humboldt FoundationAlexander von Humboldt Foundation; Division Of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1144162] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"This research was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (2012CB821900), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41572010), and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) President's International Fellowship Initiative (2011t2z04).

It is unknown when this symbiosis was first established, but the present study shows that fossil termite protists existed in the Mesozoic. Results: A new species of termite (Kalotermes burmensis n. sp.) in Early Cretaceous Burmese amber had part of its abdomen damaged, thus exposing trophic stages and cysts of diverse protists. Some protists were still attached to the gut intima while others were in the amber matrix adjacent to the damaged portion. Ten new fossil flagellate species in the Trichomonada, Hypermastigida and Oxymonadea are described in nine new genera assigned to 6 extant families. Systematic placement and names of the fossil flagellates are based on morphological similarities with extant genera associated with lower termites. The following new flagellate taxa are established: Foainites icelus n. gen. n. sp., Spiromastigites acanthodes n. gen. n. sp., Trichonymphites henis n. gen., n. sp., Teranymphites rhabdotis n. gen. n. sp., Oxymonas protus n. sp., Oxymonites gerus n. gen., n. sp., Microrhopalodites polynucleatis n. gen., n. sp., Sauromonites katatonis n. gen., n. sp., Dinenymphites spiris n. gen., n. sp., Pyrsonymphites cordylinis n. gen., n. sp. A new genus of fossil amoeba is also described as Endamoebites proterus n. gen., n. sp. Fourteen additional trophic and encystid protist stages are figured and briefly characterized. Conclusion: This represents the earliest fossil record of mutualism between microorganisms and animals and the first descriptions of protists from a fossil termite. Discovering the same orders, families and possibly genera of protists that occur today in Early Cretaceous kalotermitids shows considerable behaviour and morphological stability of both host and protists. The possible significance of protist cysts associated with the fossil termite is discussed in regards the possibility that coprophagy, as well as proctodeal trophallaxis, was a method by which some termite protozoa were transferred intrastadially and intergenerationally at this time.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Poinar, GO (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Zool, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",poinarg@science.oregonstate.edu,,,,,,31,30,35,0,11,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1756-3305,,,PARASITE VECTOR,Parasites Vectors,FEB 18,2009,2,,,,,,,,12,10.1186/1756-3305-2-12,,,17,Parasitology; Tropical Medicine,Parasitology; Tropical Medicine,436CG,WOS:000265389600001,19226475,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2021-07-18

Preserved plesiomorphic features are the following: fully sclerotized head with long coronal suture, small ommatidia not separated by chitinous bridges, absence of microtrichia between ommatidia, eight antennomeres, robust mandibles with dicondylic articulation, galea distinctly developed, free pro-and mesotrochanters, slender five-segmented tarsi without adhesive soles, and equally sclerotized abdominal tergites and sternites. An important character that is not recognizable due to damage is the shape of the metapostnotum. This structure is transverse in the groundplan of Strepsiptera and in + Protoxenos, but elongated and shield-like in all other known strepsipterans. In a cladistic analyses of 82 characters of adult males and additional characters for females and immatures (scored as unknown for all included fossils) + Kinzelbachilla is placed as sister group of all remaining strepsipterans except for + Protoxenos, followed by + Cretostylops and + Mengea as the third and fourth branches in the stem group, respectively. The position of + Protoxenos as first branch is suggested by three unambiguous apomorphic features of all remaining Strepsiptera, the reduced size of less than 6 mm, mandibles distinctly narrowing distad the basalmost part, and fan-shaped hindwings which are broader than they are long. The hitherto known fossil stem group strepsipterans do not distinctly narrow the large morphological gap separating this order from its sister group, the Coleoptera.","[Pohl, Hans; Beutel, Rolf G.] Univ Jena, Inst Spezielle Zool, Entomol Grp, Erbert Str 1, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Pohl, Hans; Beutel, Rolf G.] Univ Jena, Evolutionsbiol Mit Phyletischem Museum, Erbert Str 1, D-07743 Jena, Germany","Pohl, H; Beutel, RG (corresponding author), Univ Jena, Inst Spezielle Zool, Entomol Grp, Erbert Str 1, D-07743 Jena, Germany.; Pohl, H; Beutel, RG (corresponding author), Univ Jena, Evolutionsbiol Mit Phyletischem Museum, Erbert Str 1, D-07743 Jena, Germany.",hans.pohl@uni-jena.de; rolf.beutel@uni-jena.de,"Pohl, Hans/M-6873-2019","Pohl, Hans/0000-0002-7090-6612",Forderverein of the Phyletisches Museum e.V.,"Sieghardt Ellenberger (Kassel, Germany) made the holotype available for scientific study before the type specimen was purchased by the Phyletisches Museum (Jena).

Sorellembia estherae, new genus and species, is distinguished from the only other Mesozoic webspinner, Burmitembia venosa Cockerell. Unlike the latter taxon, S. estherae embodies an array of notable plesiomorphies for the Neoembiodea (i.e., those Embiodea with strongly asymmetrical terminalia and the tenth tergum divided). Based on its phylogenetic position, S. estherae is placed in a new family, Sorellembiidae. Burmitembia venosa, on the other hand, possesses a synapomorphic suite of traits indicating placement in the Notoligotomidae (sensu novum) and as sister to the apterous subfamily Australembiinae (status novus). Past authors have considered Burmitembia as deserving of familial status, but it seems more conservative to combine the geographically restricted and species-poor sister families Notoligotomidae and Australembiidae and to consider Burmitembia as merely a subfamily therein (as Burmitembiinae).

Whereas some species resemble nocturnal Ichneumonidae, others might be mistaken for spider wasps or different groups of brachypterous Hymenoptera. Despite their varied morphology, all members of the family supposedly develop as larval ectoparasitoids of crickets (Orthoptera: Grylloidea). Here, we report on the first record of a fossil rhopalosomatid larva which was discovered in mid-Cretaceous amber from northern Myanmar (Burma). The larva is attached to the lateral side of a cricket between the metafemur and the abdomen, impacting the natural position of the hind leg, exactly as documented for modern species. Additionally, the larval gestalt is strikingly similar to those of extant forms. These observations imply that this behavioral specialization, e.g., host association and positioning on host, likely evolved in the stem of the family at least 100 million years ago.","[Lohrmann, Volker] Ubersee Museum Bremen, Bahnhofspl 13, D-28195 Bremen, Germany; [Lohrmann, Volker] Museum Nat Kunde, Leibniz Inst Evolut & Biodiversitatsforsch, Invalidenstr 43, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Engel, Michael S.] Nat Hist Museum, Div Entomol, 1501 Crestline Dr Suite 140, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Engel, Michael S.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 1501 Crestline Dr Suite 140, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Engel, Michael S.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, Cent Pk West & 79th St, New York, NY 10024 USA","Lohrmann, V (corresponding author), Ubersee Museum Bremen, Bahnhofspl 13, D-28195 Bremen, Germany.; Lohrmann, V (corresponding author), Museum Nat Kunde, Leibniz Inst Evolut & Biodiversitatsforsch, Invalidenstr 43, D-10115 Berlin, Germany.",v.lohrmann@uebersee-museum.de,"Lohrmann, Volker/AAB-4489-2020; Engel, Michael S/C-5461-2012","Lohrmann, Volker/0000-0003-0476-7041; Engel, Michael S/0000-0003-3067-077X",,,,36,10,11,0,2,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",2193-0066,1860-1014,,FOSS REC,Foss.

Sexual reproduction involving giant sperm, shared by three superfamilies of living ostracod crustaceans, is among the most fascinating behaviours. However, the origin and evolution of this reproductive mechanism has remained largely unexplored because fossil preservation of such features is extremely rare. Here, we report exceptionally preserved ostracods with soft parts (appendages and reproductive organs) in a single piece of mid-Cretaceous Kachin amber (approximately 100 Myr old). The ostracod assemblage is composed of 39 individuals. Thirty-one individuals belong to a new species and genus,Myanmarcypris huigen. et sp. nov., exhibiting an ontogenetic sequence from juveniles to adults (male and female). Seven individuals are assigned toThalassocypriasp. (Cypridoidea, Candonidae, Paracypridinae) and one toSanyuaniasp. (Cytheroidea, Loxoconchidae). Our micro-CT reconstruction provides direct evidence of the male clasper, sperm pumps (Zenker organs), hemipenes, eggs and female seminal receptacles with giant sperm. Our results reveal that the reproduction behavioural repertoire, which is associated with considerable morphological adaptations, has remained unchanged over at least 100 million years-a paramount example of evolutionary stasis. These results also double the age of the oldest unequivocal fossil animal sperm. This discovery highlights the capacity of amber to document invertebrate soft parts that are rarely recorded by other depositional environments.","[Wang, He; Zhao, Xiangdong; Cao, Meizhen; Zhang, Haichun; Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Wang, He; Zhao, Xiangdong; Cao, Meizhen; Zhang, Haichun; Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Matzke-Karasz, Renate] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Earth & Environm Sci Palaeontol & Geobiol, Richard Wagner Str 10, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Horne, David J.] Queen Mary Univ London, Sch Geog, Mile End Rd, London E1 4NS, England; [Zhao, Xiangdong] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Wang, H; Wang, B (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China.; Wang, H; Wang, B (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China.",hwang@nigpas.ac.cn; bowang@nigpas.ac.cn,,"Matzke-Karasz, Renate/0000-0002-8010-2028; Horne, David J./0000-0002-2148-437X",Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB26000000]; Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research [2019QZKK0706]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41688103],"This research was supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDB26000000), the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (2019QZKK0706) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41688103).",,37,1,2,0,2,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

The discovery of four mushroom forms, most with a complete intact cap containing distinct gills and a stalk, suggests evolutionary stasis of body form for similar to 99 Myr and highlights the palaeodiversity of Agaricomycetes. The mouthparts of early oxyporines, including enlarged mandibles and greatly enlarged apical labial palpomeres with dense specialized sensory organs, match those of modern taxa and suggest that they had a mushroom feeding biology. Diverse and morphologically specialized oxyporines from the Early Cretaceous suggests the existence of diverse Agaricomycetes and a specialized trophic interaction and ecological community structure by this early date.","[Cai, Chenyang] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, Key Lab Econ Stratig & Palaeogeog, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Cai, Chenyang; Huang, Diying] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Leschen, Richard A.

The larvae most often seem to retain rather plesiomorphic-appearing cutting-grinding mouth parts. Here we report a new unusual larva preserved in Burmese amber. Its mouth parts appear beak-like, forming a distinct piercing mouth cone. Such a morphology is extremely rare among larval forms, restricted to those of some beetles and lacewings. The mouth parts of the new fossil are forward oriented (prognathous). Additionally, the larva has distinct subdivisions of tergites and sternites into several sclerites. Also, the abdomen segments bear prominent protrusions. We discuss this unusual combination of characters in comparison to the many different types of holometabolan larvae.

Five new Mantodea are described from Cretaceous deposits on four continents, including: concretions in limestone from the Santana Formation of northeast Brazil (Aptian, 120 Ma), inclusions in amber from the Raritan Formation of New Jersey, USA (Turonian, 90 Ma), and in amber from undetermined formations of Lebanon (Barremian, 125 Ma) and northern Myanmar (Burma) (approximately early Cenomanian to late Albian, 100 Ma). Prior to this, virtually all of the oldest mantises were from five Cretaceous localities in Eurasia. New Mantodea are Santanmantis axelrodi, n. gen., n. sp. (Brazil); Ambermantis wozniaki, n. gen., n. sp. (New Jersey); Jersimantis burmiticus, n. sp. (Myaninar); and Burmantis asiatica and B. lebanensis, n. gen. and n. spp. (Myanmar and Lebanon, respectively). The first two are based on adults, the last three on nymphs. Cladistic analysis of 26 morphological characters and 20 taxa, including living families and well-preserved fossils, indicates that Cretaceous mantises are phylogenetically basal to all living species and do not belong to the most basal living families Chaeteessidae, Mantoididae, and Metallyticidae. The classification of Cretaceous Mantodea is revised, which includes Santanmantidae, n. fam. and Ambermantidae, n. fam. Stratigraphic and cladistic ranks of taxa, with now improved fossil sampling, indicate that the order Mantodea is relatively recent like Isoptera (termites), with an origin no earlier than Late Jurassic.

Their ecological success is generally attributed to their remarkable social behavior. Not all ants cooperate in social hunting, however, and some of the most effective predatory ants are solitary hunters with powerful trap jaws [10]. Recent evolutionary studies predict that the early branching lineages of extant ants formed small colonies of ground-dwelling, solitary specialist predators [2, 5, 7, 11, 12], while some Cretaceous fossils suggest group recruitment and socially advanced behavior among stem-group ants [9]. We describe a trap-jaw ant from 99 million-year-old Burmese amber with head structures that presumably functioned as a highly specialized trap for large-bodied prey. These are a cephalic horn resulting from an extreme modification of the clypeus hitherto unseen among living and extinct ants and scythe-like mandibles that extend high above the head, both demonstrating the presence of exaggerated morphogenesis early among stem-group ants. The new ant belongs to the Haidomyrmecini, possibly the earliest ant lineage [9], and together these trap-jaw ants suggest that at least some of the earliest Formicidae were solitary specialist predators. With their peculiar adaptations, haidomyrmecines had a refined ecology shortly following the advent of ants.","[Perrichot, Vincent] Univ Rennes 1, CNRS, UMR Geosci 6118, F-35042 Rennes, France; [Perrichot, Vincent] Univ Rennes 1, OSUR, F-35042 Rennes, France; [Perrichot, Vincent; Engel, Michael S.] Univ Kansas, Biodivers Inst, Div Entomol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Perrichot, Vincent; Engel, Michael S.] Univ Kansas, Nat Hist Museum, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Engel, Michael S.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA","Perrichot, V (corresponding author), Univ Rennes 1, CNRS, UMR Geosci 6118, F-35042 Rennes, France.; Perrichot, V (corresponding author), Univ Rennes 1, OSUR, F-35042 Rennes, France.; Perrichot, V (corresponding author), Univ Kansas, Biodivers Inst, Div Entomol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.; Perrichot, V (corresponding author), Univ Kansas, Nat Hist Museum, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.; Wang, B (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",vincent.perrichot@univ-rennes1.fr; bowang@nigpas.ac.cn,"Perrichot, Vincent/I-4134-2019; Engel, Michael S/C-5461-2012","Perrichot, Vincent/0000-0002-7973-0430; Engel, Michael S/0000-0003-3067-077X",National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41572010]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of CAS [2011224]; Synthesys visiting grant [GB-TAF-2549],"We thank Sieghard Ellenberger, who made some of the fossils available for study; D.H.

Zorotypus cretatus, new species, is represented by an apterous individual of indeterminate sex whereas Z. nascimbenei, new species, is represented by an alate female and Z. acanthothorax, new species, is known from an alate male. Xenozorotypus burmiticus, new genus and species, is represented by an alate male and possesses distinct plesiomorphies suggesting that it may be sister to all other zorapterans (Recent and extinct). Based on some peculiar apomorphies of the metafemoral and terminalic structure as well as wing venation it is placed in a separate genus. These species, particularly Z. cretatus, Z acanthothorax, and Z. nascimbenei, are remarkably similar to living zorapterans, which indicates antiquity of the genus Zorotypus and the order, the latter perhaps Lowermost Mesozoic in origin.

Fossil traces of such behaviours are better known among the vertebrates, e.g. the hypertelic antlers of the Pleistocene giant deer Megaloceros giganteus. Here we describe spectacular extremely expanded, pod-like tibiae in males of a platycnemidid damselfly from mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber. Such structures in modern damselflies, help to fend off other suitors as well as attract mating females, increasing the chances of successful mating. Modern Platycnemidinae and Chlorocyphidae convergently acquired similar but less developed structures. The new findings provide suggestive evidence of damselfly courtship behaviour as far back as the mid-Cretaceous. These data show an unexpected morphological disparity in dancing damselfly leg structure, and shed new light on mechanisms of sexual selection involving intra- and intersex reproductive competition during the Cretaceous.","[Zheng, Daran; Jarzembowski, Edmund A.; Zhang, Haichun; Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Daran; Chang, Su-Chin] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Earth Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Nel, Andre] Sorbonne Univ, Inst Systemat, ISYEB UMR CNRS 7205,Entomol,UPMC, Evolut,Biodiversite,MNHN,EPHE,Museum Natl Hist N, 57 Rue Cuvier,CP 50, F-75005 Paris, France; [Jarzembowski, Edmund A.] Nat Hist Museum, Dept Earth Sci, London SW7 5BD, England; [Xia, Fangyuan; Liu, Haoying] Nanjiao Bieshu 394, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, 1,Beichen West Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Zheng, DR; Wang, B (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Zheng, DR; Chang, SC (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Dept Earth Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.; Wang, B (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, 1,Beichen West Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",dranzheng@gmail.com; suchin@hku.hk; bowang@nigpas.ac.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41572010, 41622201, 41688103]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [2011224]; Chinese Academy of Sciences President's International Fellowship Initiative [2011T2Z04]; HKU Seed Funding Program for Basic ResearchUniversity of Hong Kong [201210159058]","This research was supported (grant nos in parentheses) by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41572010, 41622201, 41688103), Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (2011224), the Chinese Academy of Sciences President's International Fellowship Initiative (2011T2Z04), and the HKU Seed Funding Program for Basic Research (201210159058).

The amber species are exceptional, with the hind wing reduced to a minute lobe, the antennal flagellum modified into an arista, labial palps are lost, and - like the Late Jurassic species - the laciniae and what are probably mandibles are modified into a long, stylet-like proboscis.

The latter two species interestingly possess stylate antennae, those of Burmazelmira being the only aristate antennae in the order Diptera outside the suborder Brachycera. A cladogram is presented for the relationships among archizelmirid species, cladistic rank of which correlates with stratigraphic age. Transformation series of the antennal flagellum in Archizelmiridae corresponds with one recently hypothesized for the Brachycera, wherein the style and arista are derived from the apical flagellomere(s).

As many as 94 out of every 100 individual arthropods in rainforests are ants [1], and they constitute up to 15% of animal biomass in the Amazon [2, 3]. Moreover, ants are pervasive agents of natural selection as over 10,000 arthropod species are specialized inquilines or myrmecomorphs living among ants or defending themselves through mimicry [4, 5]. Such impact is traditionally explained by sociality: ants are the first major group of ground-dwelling predatory insects to become eusocial [3], increasing efficiency of tasks and establishing competitive superiority over solitary species [6, 7]. A wealth of specimens from rich deposits of 99 million-year-old Burmese amber resolves ambiguity regarding sociality and diversity in the earliest ants. The stem-group genus Gerontoformica maintained distinct reproductive castes including morphotypes unknown in solitary aculeate (stinging) wasps, providing insight into early behavior. We present rare aggregations of workers, indicating group recruitment as well as an instance of interspecific combat; such aggression is a social feature of modern ants. Two species and an unusual new genus are described, further expanding the remarkable diversity of early ants. Stem-group ants are recovered as a paraphyletic assemblage at the base of modern lineages varying greatly in size, form, and mouthpart structure, interpreted here as an adaptive radiation. Though Cretaceous stem-group ants were eusocial and adaptively diverse, we hypothesize that their extinction resulted from the rise of competitively superior crown-group taxa that today form massive colonies, consistent with Wilson and Ho lldobler's concept of dynastic succession.''","[Barden, Phillip; Grimaldi, David A.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, Cent Pk West & 79th St, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Barden, Phillip] Rutgers State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Newark, NJ 07102 USA; [Grimaldi, David A.] Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Grimaldi, David A.] CUNY, Grad Ctr, New York, NY 10016 USA","Barden, P (corresponding author), Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, Cent Pk West & 79th St, New York, NY 10024 USA.; Barden, P (corresponding author), Rutgers State Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Newark, NJ 07102 USA.",pbarden@amnh.org,,"Barden, Phillip/0000-0001-6277-320X",Richard Gilder Graduate School (AMNH); National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1313547],"We thank Tyler Janovitz, James Zigras, and Scott Anderson for providing specimens; Stefan Cover, Gavin Broad, and Vincent Perrichot for advice, hosting visits, and providing access to specimens in the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Natural History Museum in London, and University of Rennes, respectively; Morgan Hill and Henry Towbin at the AMNH Microscopy and Imaging Facility and Mark Riccio at the Cornell Biotechnology Resource Center Imaging Facility for assistance with CT imaging; Paul Nascimbene (AMNH) for amber preparation of delicate and important specimens; and Steve Thurston for figure preparation.

The fossil species differs from extant species of Haemoproteus by its wide range of oocyst sizes, small sporozoites and occurrence in an extinct species of biting midge. Numerous sporozoites in the abdominal cavity suggest that the biting midge was an effective vector of this malarial parasite.

While barb-based feather forms were investigated, feather shafts and vanes are understudied. Here, we take a multi-disciplinary approach to study their molecular control and bio-architectural organizations. In rachidial ridges, epidermal progenitors generate cortex and medullary keratinocytes, guided by Bmp and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) signaling that convert rachides into adaptable bilayer composite beams. In barb ridges, epidermal progenitors generate cylindrical, plate-, or hooklet-shaped barbule cells that form fluffy branches or pennaceous vanes, mediated by asymmetric cell junction and keratin expression. Transcriptome analyses and functional studies show anterior-posterior Wnt2b signaling within the dermal papilla controls barbule cell fates with spatiotemporal collinearity. Quantitative bio-physical analyses of feathers from birds with different flight characteristics and feathers in Burmese amber reveal how multi-dimensional functionality can be achieved and may inspire future composite material designs.","[Chang, Wei-Ling; Wu, Hao; Lai, Yung-Chi; Lei, Mingxing; Hung, Shih-Chieh; Juan, Wen-Tau] CMUH, ISSC, Taichung 40447, Taiwan; [Chang, Wei-Ling; Shieh, Shyh-Jou] NCKU, lnt Ctr Wound Repair & Regenerat iWRR, Tainan 701, Taiwan; [Wu, Hao; Chiu, Yu-Kun; Gu, How-Jen; Lin, Tse-Yu; Yang, Shun-Min; Lee, Tsung-Tse; Tsai, J.

Inclusions in Taimyr amber (84-100 Ma) assigned to Baeomorpha are reviewed and the following eleven new species, all of Gumovsky, are described: B. avamica sp. nov., B. baikurenis sp. nov., B. bianellus sp. nov., B. caeleps sp. nov., B. gracilis sp. nov., B. ingens sp. nov., B. quattorduo sp. nov., B. quattoruno sp. nov., B. popovi sp. nov., B. yanfardakh sp. nov., and B. zherikhini sp. nov. The recognized species are differentiated in separate keys to females and males and illustrated through microphotography. Two of four previously described Baeomorpha species from Campanian Canadian amber are synonymized: B. distincta Yoshimoto and B. elongata Yoshimoto under B. ovatata Yoshimoto (syn. nov.). One enigmatic rotoitid inclusion, which differs from Baeomorpha species in the possession of very short stigmal vein, is described as Taimyromorpha pusilla Gumovsky gen. et sp. nov. inclusions containing specimens identified as Baeomorpha and Taimyromorpha are found in amber from Taimyr and Canada that originated from Laurasia, not Gondwana. Two Realms are newly proposed to recognize different Cretaceous faunal elements, a more northern Baeomorpha Realm that is characterized by a temperate or warm temperate climate and very abundant aphid fossils, and the Isoptera Realm, an opposing southward territory with a warmer climate and common termite but rare aphid fossils. The newly described fossils indicate the southern hemisphere distribution of extant Rotoitidae is relictual with the pattern observed being formed at least in part by extinction events, though distributions of the only two extant rotoitid genera, Rotoita Boutek and Noyes, 1987 (New Zealand) and Chiloe Gibson and Huber, 2000 (small area in the southern Chile) may have been more extensive in the past. Both of known regions of extant Rotoitidae have highly suppressed ant faunas, which may suggest that their survival there depended on low biocenotic pressure by ants, perhaps as low as is hypothesized for the Late Cretaceous. The Canadian amber genera Distylopus Yoshimoto, 1975 (Distylopinae) and Bouceklytus Yoshimoto, 1975 (Bouceklytinae) are excluded from Tetracampidae and regarded as Chalcidoidea incertae sedis.

Gender agreement in Ochterus paucistriata Baehr, 1990 is corrected to O. paucistriatus Baehr, 1990. The name Ochterus perbosci (Guerin-Meneville, 1843), an incorrect subsequent spelling of O. perboscii in prevailing usage, is fixed according to Article 33.3.1 of the ICZN (1999). The spelling of Angulochterus quadrimaculatus Yao, Zhang & Ren, 2011 is corrected according to Article 32.5.1 of ICZN (1999). The original publication of Ochterus barberi Schell, 1943, O. bidentatus Schell, 1943, O. hungerfordi Schell, 1943, and O. parvus Schell, 1943 is clarified. The name bearing types of Ochterus barberi, O. bidentatus, O. hungerfordi, O. parvus, O. perbosci, and Pelogonus splendidulus Montandon, 1898 (= Ocyochterus victor (Bolivar, 1879)) are considered as lectotypes. The family Ochteridae currently includes 3 recent genera and 88 described species group taxa (84 species and 4 subspecies): Megochterus Jaczewski, 1934 (2 species from Australia), Ochterus (80 species and 4 subspecies distributed worldwide), and Ocyochterus Drake & Gomez-Menor, 1954 (2 species from NW South America).

NOV.; EVOLUTION; BUTTERFLIES; EXTINCTION; DYNAMICS; LEBANESE; INSIGHTS; BEETLES; WASPS,"Batesian mimicry is a relationship in which a harmful organism (the model) is mimicked by a harmless organism (the mimic), which gains protection because predators mistake it for the model. It is the most widely studied of mimicry complexes and has undoubtedly played an important role in the speciation of various animals especially insects. However, little is known about the early evolution of this important behavior and its evolutionary significance owing to a dearth of paleontological records. Here we report several specialized representatives of the family Alienopteridae from the Early Cretaceous of Brazil, mid-Cretaceous Burmite, and the Eocene of the USA. They exhibit unique morphological adaptations for wasp and ant mimicry and represent one of the oldest evidence of Batesian mimicry in the insect fossil record.

The evolutionary history of mantidflies remains largely unknown due to a scarcity of fossils. Here, we report the discovery of a highly diverse palaeofauna of mantidflies from the mid-Cretaceous (lowermost Cenomanian) of Myanmar. The raptorial forelegs of these mantidflies possess highly divergent morphological modifications, some of which are unknown among modern mantidflies, e.g. the presence of forked basal profemoral spines or even the complete loss of foreleg spine-like structures. A phylogenetic analysis of Mantispidae reveals a pattern of raptorial foreleg evolution across the family. The high species diversity and disparate foreleg characters might have been driven by diverse niches of predator-prey interplay in the complex tropical forest ecosystem of the mid-Cretaceous.","[Lu, Xiumei; Liu, Xingyue] China Agr Univ, Dept Entomol, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Lu, Xiumei] Shanghai Acad Agr Sci, Inst Ecol & Environm Protect, Shanghai 201403, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Weiwei] Three Gorges Entomol Museum, POB 4680, Chongqing 400015, Peoples R China; [Ohl, Michael] Museum Naturkunde, Dept Biodivers Discovery, Invalidenstr 43, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Engel, Michael S.] Univ Kansas, Div Entomol, Nat Hist Museum, 1501 Crestline Dr Suite 140, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Engel, Michael S.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 1501 Crestline Dr Suite 140, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Engel, Michael S.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, Cent Pk West & 79th St, New York, NY 10024 USA","Liu, XY (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Dept Entomol, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",xingyue_liu@yahoo.com,"Liu, Xingyue/A-3019-2013; Engel, Michael S/C-5461-2012","Liu, Xingyue/0000-0002-9168-0659; Engel, Michael S/0000-0003-3067-077X; Lu, Xiumei/0000-0002-3494-7871","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31972871, 31900348, 31672322, 41688103]; Changjiang Scholars Program (2018); Shanghai Sailing Program [19YF1443000]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB26000000]","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant nos. 31972871, 31900348, 31672322 and 41688103), the Changjiang Scholars Program (2018), the Shanghai Sailing Program (grant no. 19YF1443000) and the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (grant no.

The recent studies based on new material, especially from the Cenomanian Burmese amber, shed light on evolutionary history of Acercaria resolving Permopsocida as the stem group of Condylognatha. However, the knowledge of the remaining two orders differs significantly. Results: In this study, we describe new specimens and evaluate morphology of various structures with emphasis on the mouthparts and wing venation. Our results are primary based on revisions of the type specimens with a proper delimitation of taxa Hypoperlida and Miomoptera followed by their significance for the evolutionary history of Acercaria. Three new genera as Belmomantis gen. nov., Elmomantis gen. nov., and Mazonopsocus gen. nov. are designated as members of Palaeomanteidae. The Pennsylvanian Mazonopsocus provides a minimum age for calibration, in accordance to the presence of crown acercarians during the late Carboniferous. Conclusions: This contribution demonstrates that Hypoperlida and Miomoptera are stem groups of Acercaria. The putative clade (Hypoperlida + Miomoptera) is appearing as potential sister group of (Psocodea + (Permopsocida + (Thripida + Hemiptera))).","[Prokop, Jakub; Pecharova, Martina] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, Vinicna 7, Prague 12843 2, Czech Republic; [Garrouste, Romain; Chintauan-Marquier, Ioana C.; Nel, Andre] Sorbonne Univ, UPMC, MNHN,CNRS,Entomol, Inst Systemat Evolut Biodivers ISYEB EPHE UMR 72, 57 Rue Cuvier,CP 50, F-75005 Paris, France; [Beattie, Robert] Australian Museum, 1 William St, Sydney, NSW 2010, Australia","Nel, A (corresponding author), Sorbonne Univ, UPMC, MNHN,CNRS,Entomol, Inst Systemat Evolut Biodivers ISYEB EPHE UMR 72, 57 Rue Cuvier,CP 50, F-75005 Paris, France.",anel@mnhn.fr,"Chintauan-Marquier, Ioana C./F-5830-2013; Prokop, Jakub/B-1432-2008; GARROUSTE, Romain/AAK-3692-2021","Chintauan-Marquier, Ioana C./0000-0002-4066-6902; Prokop, Jakub/0000-0001-6996-7832; GARROUSTE, Romain/0000-0002-0880-5781; Pecharova, Martina/0000-0003-4611-1868","Agency of the Czech RepublicGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [14-03847 J]; ICCM; Agence Nationale de la Recherche under LabExFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-10-LABX-0003-BCDiv, ANR-11-IDEX-0004-02]","The first author (J.P.) acknowledges the financial support of the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic (No. 14-03847 J).

We describe here a new lacewing larva, Ankyloleon caudatus gen. et sp.n. (Neuroptera) from the Cretaceous amber of Myanmar, characterized by an abdomen unique among insects, with 'tail-like' terminal segments bearing a ventral pair of vesicles. Phase-contrast X-ray microtomography reveals that these structures were dense and equipped with a median duct, suggesting that they were likely pygopods used for locomotion, holding the position through adhesive secretions. Our phylogenetic analyses, combining genomic and morphological data from both living and fossil lacewings, proved critical to placing Ankyloleon gen.n. on the lacewing tree of life as an early representative of the antlion clade, Myrmeleontiformia. These results corroborate the view that derived myrmeleontiform lacewings 'experimented' with unusual combinations of features and specializations during their evolutionary history, some of which are now lost.

The dominance of Aeshnidae is consistent with other Paleocene and Eocene fossil localities. Auroradraco eos is the only fossil Gomphidae in the roughly 66-million-year gap between occurrences in mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber and the early Oligocene of France. Ypshna appears close to Parabaissaeshna ejerslevense from the early Eocene Fur Formation of Denmark; this is not surprising given Holarctic intercontinental connections at this time and a growing list of insect taxa shared between the Okanagan Highlands and the Fur Formation.","[Archibald, S.

Here I assemble measurements of over 260 published mite fossils, distributed from the Early Devonian (410 mya) to the end of the Neogene (5 mya), and compare them to the data available for their extant relatives. A number of fossils are reconsidered: reports of the Ordovician Brachypylina and Permian Astigmata have to be excluded from the fossil record; Jurassic fossils of Trhypochthoniidae (Nothrina) are reconsidered as Neoliodidae (Brachypylina) and Desmonomata (Brachypylina or Nothrina). Based on these data, mites began small. From the oldest, Paleozoic, fossils through the Jurassic, Sarcoptiformes show a positive size trend, which then ceases. The smallest mites, are recovered from the Triassic amber. Cretaceous amber fossils show wide size range, which further increases through the Cenozoic. Fossils of mites tend to fall within size ranges of their extant relatives mostly on the smaller side of those ranges. Paleozoic fossils, however, tend to be on the larger side of their relatives' size range. What can be called a Jurassic anomaly - a set of much larger-than-extant fossils currently attributed to Cymbaeremaeidae - calls for further study.","[Sidorchuk, Ekaterina A.] Russian Acad Sci, Paleontol Inst, Moscow, Russia; [Sidorchuk, Ekaterina A.] Tyumen State Univ, Int Integrated Res Lab Climate Change Land Use &, Tyumen, Russia","Sidorchuk, EA (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, Paleontol Inst, Moscow, Russia.",e.a.sidorchuk@gmail.com,,"Sidorchuk, Ekaterina/0000-0002-2009-5276",,,,93,10,13,1,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0164-7954,1945-3892,,INT J ACAROL,Int.

A further comparison between Nilionympha and other gumilline genera is provided to corroborate the generic status according to the updated diagnostic characters of forewing. The species Nilionympha imperfecta Ren and Engel, 2007 is transferred to the genus of Enodinympha. Gumillinae, a particular subfamily within Osmylidae, are characterized by the long antennae and absence of ocelli. The only extant genus Gumilla is restricted in South America (Navas, 1912, Martins et al., 2016). However, the hitherto diverse and widely distributed gumilline fossils represent nine worldwide genera (Winterton et al., 2017) with only one fossil genus of Nuddsia in the Southern Hemisphere from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil (Menon & Makarkin, 2008, Martins-Neto & Rodrigues, 2010). The other genera are widely distributed in the northern regions. Two other Cretaceous genera have been recorded respectively from southern England (Osmylochrysa) and Myanmar (Burmese) amber (Burmaleon) (Jepson et al., 2012, Myskowiak et al., 2016). The diversity of the Jurassic gumillines was broader with six genera hitherto. The genus Epiosmylus was firstly documented in the Late Jurassic of Karatau (Panfilov, 1980), and subsequently, two species were described respectively from the Middle Jurassic of Daohugou, China and West Siberian Kubekovo, Russia (Ren & Yin, 2002, Khramov, 2017). In addition, Khramov (2014) described another genus Kolbasinella from the Karatau locality (Khramov, 2014). The Daohugou locality is well-known for the well-preserved and diverse insect fossils (Ren et al., 2010, Wang et al., 2010, 2012, Gao et al., 2012, Gu et al., 2012, Yao et al., 2014, Wang et al., 2016). It has hitherto yielded five gumilline genera, i.e. Epiosmylus, Enodinympha, Nilionympha, Tenuosmylus and Allotriosmylus (Ren & Yin, 2002, Ren & Engel, 2007, Wang et al., 2009, Yang et al., 2010). Among them, the genus Nilionympha was not well-documented due to the absence of forewing information when it was established (Ren & Engel, 2007). Herein we reexamined the type specimens referring to the Nilionympha species and emended the generic diagnosis by incorporating the forewing information. We describe a new species Nilionympha shantouensis sp. nov. from the Middle Jurassic Jiulongshan Formation of Daohugou, Inner Mongolia, China. Based on the analysis of forewing, we deem that the species N. imperfecta should be transferred to Enodinympha.","[Li, Qinghua; Ren, Dong; Wang, Yongjie] Capital Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, 105 Xisanhuanbeilu, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China","Wang, YJ (corresponding author), Capital Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, 105 Xisanhuanbeilu, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China.",wangyjosmy@gmail.com,,,"National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31301905, 41688103, 41372013]; Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of ChinaResearch Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China (RFDP)Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education (SRFDP) [20131108120005]; Youth Innovative Research Team of Capital Normal University; Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in UniversityProgram for Changjiang Scholars & Innovative Research Team in University (PCSIRT) [IRT-17R75]","We thank Dr. Chungkun Shih (College of Life Sciences, Capital Normal University) for improving the manuscript.

The fossil data is combined with the characters of the recent representatives of Cerophytidae to build a new phylogenetic hypothesis of their relationships. Twenty-three in-group taxa and three out-groups were included in a maximum parsimony cladistic analysis based on 32 adult characters. The resulting tree confirms the family Cerophytidae as a monophylum with two weakly supported clades, segregating most of the extinct Mesozoic and extant genera into separate clades. The new concept of the family Cerophytidae is presented to reconcile characters of the Mesozoic and recent taxa, without recognition of Aphytocerinae Kirejtshuk, 2013. Lebanophytum Kirejtshuk and Azar (=Lebanophytidae Kirejtshuk in Kirejtshuk and Azar, 2013), originally placed in Cerophytidae, is removed from Elateroidea and placed in the cucujoid family Cryptophagidae. The family Lebanophytidae Kirejtshuk in Kirejtshuk and Azar, 2013, based on this genus, becomes a junior synonym of Cryptophagidae Kirby, 1826 (syn. nov.). The two species Praelaterium problematicum Dolin, 1973 and Elaterocoleus oculatus Dolin, 1973, originally included in the family Praelateriidae Dolin, are moved to the family Cerophytidae, and Praelateriidae Dolin, 1973 is regarded as a junior synonym of Cerophytidae Latreille, 1834 (syn. nov.).

However, in 400 million years of evolution [1, 2], specialized devices were independently acquired in several groups to adopt these tasks, as for instance modified legs in mantids, assassin bugs or stick insects [3-5], or clasping antennae of the globular springtails [6]. So far, no known species used the neck region between the head and thorax in one of these functional contexts. Here we describe females of yCaputoraptor elegans, a very unusual, presumably predacious insect discovered in approximately 100-million-year-old [7] Burmese amber. Based on several morphological features, we conclude that this species lived in the foliage of trees or bushes. A unique feature of the new taxon is a scissor-like mechanism formed by wing-like extensions on the posterior head and corresponding serrated edges of the dorsal sclerite of the first thoracic segment. Based on the specific structure of the apparatus, we conclude that it was probably used by females to hold on to males during copulation. A defensive or prey-catching function appears less likely. A similar mechanism did not evolve in any other known known group of extant or extinct insects.","[Bai, Ming; Zhang, Weiwei; Wang, Shuo; Yang, Xingke; Wipfler, Benjamin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, Box 92,Beichen West Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Beutel, Rolf Georg; Yan, Evgeny; Wipfler, Benjamin] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Zool & Evolut Forsch, Entomol Grp, Erbertstr 1, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Zhang, Weiwei] POB 4680, Chongqing 400015, Peoples R China; [Hoernig, Marie] Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Zool Inst & Museum, Cytol & Evolutionary Biol, Soldmannstr 23, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany; [Groehn, Carsten] Bunebuttler Weg 7, D-21509 Glinde, Germany","Yang, XK; Wipfler, B (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, Box 92,Beichen West Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.; Wipfler, B (corresponding author), Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Zool & Evolut Forsch, Entomol Grp, Erbertstr 1, D-07743 Jena, Germany.",yangxk@ioz.ac.cn; benjamin.wipfler@uni-jena.de,,"Hornig, Marie K./0000-0002-0401-2282","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31672345, 31772496, 31350110218]; Research Equipment Development Project of Chinese Academy of Sciences [YZ201509]; Marie Sklodowska-Curie Innovative Training Networks [642241-BIG4-H2020-MSCA-ITN-2014]; Alexander von Humboldt Research FoundationAlexander von Humboldt Foundation; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [WI 4324/1-1]","We thank Hans Pohl for helping with the reconstruction and Ning Wang, Shi-Yan Yang, and Huimin Chu for providing the material; Hai-Dong Yang, Teng-Fei Qiu, Cai-Xia Gao, Jorg Hammel, and Julia Herzen for assistance with photography and computed tomography (CT) scans; the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF) and Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) for beam time; and staffs 4W1A and 4W1B of the BSRF and staff 13W of the SSRF for analytical assistance.

However, the origin and early evolution of the cockroach ootheca is poorly known, attributable to a lack of fossil evidence from the Mesozoic. Here, we report the earliest known cockroach fossil possessing an internally partitioned ootheca: Piniblattella yixianensis Gao, Shih & Ren sp. nov. is described from the mid Early Cretaceous Yixian Formation of China. The ootheca of this species measures 46-62% of its body length, contains 60-70 eggs, and exhibits the oviparity B reproduction mode, similar to that of the extant ectobiid and blattid cockroaches. In conjunction with several isolated ootheca specimens preserved in the mid-Cretaceous Myanmar amber (Burmite), we infer that the cockroach reproductive mode using the complete oothecate structure occurred during or before the mid Early Cretaceous. Maternal care associated with the oothecate condition in these Cretaceous cockroaches added a unique and major life-history trait, later resulting in true viviparity. This new life-history trait providing maternal protection and care may have been a key factor in the subsequent evolutionary diversification and ecological expansion of modern cockroach lineages.","[Gao, Taiping; Shih, Chungkun; Labandeira, Conrad C.; Liu, Xin; Ren, Dong] Capital Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China; [Shih, Chungkun; Labandeira, Conrad C.] Smithsonian Inst, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Dept Paleobiol, Washingto, DC 20013 USA; [Labandeira, Conrad C.] Univ Maryland, Dept Entomol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Labandeira, Conrad C.] Univ Maryland, BEES Program, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Wang, Zongqing; Che, Yanli] Southwest Univ, Coll Plant Protect, Inst Entomol, Chongqing 400716, Peoples R China; [Yin, Xiangchu] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Plateau Biol, 23 Xinning Rd, Xining 810008, Qinghai, Peoples R China","Gao, TP; Ren, D (corresponding author), Capital Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China.",tpgao@cnu.edu.cn; rendong@mail.cnu.edu.cn,"Gao, Taiping/Z-3987-2019","Gao, Taiping/0000-0002-8118-8708","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31730087, 41688103, 31672323]; Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in UniversityProgram for Changjiang Scholars & Innovative Research Team in University (PCSIRT) [IRT-17R75]; Support Project of High-level Teachers in Beijing Municipal Universities in the Period of 13th Five-year Plan [IDHT20180518]; Young Elite Scientist Sponsorship Program by CAST (YESS); Natural Science Foundation of Beijing, ChinaBeijing Natural Science Foundation [5182004]; Science and Technology Development Program of Beijing Municipal Commission of Education [KM201610028009]","We are grateful to Dr Alexandr P.

Detailed analyses of diagnostic characters given by previous authors for dagger Haplochelus (dagger Haplochelidae) and tLepichelus (= Lepiceroides) (Lepiceridae) led to conclusions that some features might have been misinterpreted, others do not differ from those in Lepicerus, and the remaining morphological structures can be regarded as variable within one genus.

Lepicerus mumia, although classified in the extant genus, shows an unusual, presumably ancestral myxophagan character state, a partly divided protarsus, with a distinctly demarcated, enlarged and curved tarsomere 1. The presence of a crust partly covering the body of L. mumia suggests a similar biology as that of two extant species that live near river banks among other semiaquatic arthropods.

Little is known, however, about the early evolution of lepidopteran scales and their photonic structures. We report scale architectures from Jurassic Lepidoptera from the United Kingdom, Germany, Kazakhstan, and China and from Tarachoptera (a stem group of Amphiesmenoptera) from mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber. The Jurassic lepidopterans exhibit a type 1 bilayer scale vestiture: an upper layer of large fused cover scales and a lower layer of small fused ground scales. This scale arrangement, plus preserved herringbone ornamentation on the cover scale surface, is almost identical to those of some extant Micropterigidae. Critically, the fossil scale ultrastructures have periodicities measuring from 140 to 2000 nm and are therefore capable of scattering visible light, providing the earliest evidence of structural colors in the insect fossil record. Optical modeling confirms that diffraction related scattering mechanisms dominate the photonic properties of the fossil cover scales, which would have displayed broadband metallic hues as in numerous extant Micropterigidae. The fossil tarachopteran scales exhibit a unique suite of characteristics, including small size, elongate-spatulate shape, ridged ornamentation, and irregular arrangement, providing novel insight into the early evolution of lepidopteran scales. Combined, our results provide the earliest evidence for structural coloration in fossil lepidopterans and support the hypothesis that fused wing scales and the type 1 bilayer covering are groundplan features of the group. Wing scales likely had deep origins in earlier amphiesmenopteran lineages before the appearance of the Lepidoptera.","[Zhang, Qingqing; Jarzembowski, Edmund A.; Ren, Xiaoyin; Chen, Jun; Zhang, Haichun; Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qingqing] Univ Sci & Technol China, Hefei 230026, Peoples R China; [Mey, Wolfram] Humboldt Univ, Leibniz Inst Evolut & Biodivers Res, Museum Nat Kunde, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Ansorge, Joerg] Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Inst Geog & Geol, D-17487 Greifswald, Germany; [Starkey, Timothy A.] Univ Exeter, Dept Phys & Astron, Stocker Rd, Exeter EX4 4QL, Devon, England; [McDonald, Luke T.; McNamara, Maria E.] Univ Coll Cork, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, North Mall, Cork T23 TK30, Ireland; [Jarzembowski, Edmund A.] Nat Hist Museum, Dept Earth Sci, London SW7 5BD, England; [Wichard, Wilfried] Univ Cologne, Inst Biol & Its Didact, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; [Kelly, Richard] Univ Bristol, Sch Earth Sci, Bristol BS8 1TQ, Avon, England; [Kelly, Richard] Natl Museum Scotland, Dept Nat Sci, Edinburgh EH1 1JF, Midlothian, Scotland; [Chen, Jun] Linyi Univ, Inst Geol & Paleontol, Linyi 276000, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Wang, B (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Wang, B (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",bowang@nigpas.ac.cn,"McNamara, Maria E/C-8431-2014","McNamara, Maria E/0000-0003-0968-4624; Ansorge, Jorg/0000-0002-1284-6893","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41572010, 41622201, 41688103]; Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDPB05]; Museum fur Naturkunde (Berlin); European Research CouncilEuropean Research Council (ERC)European Commission [H202-2014-ER-StG-637691-ANICOLEVO]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [2011224]","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41572010, 41622201, and 41688103), Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDPB05), and the Museum fur Naturkunde (Berlin).

This study aimed to determine the evolution of the P. vivax multidrug resistance 1 (Pvmdr1) gene in P. vivax parasites isolated from the China-Myanmar border area during the major phase of elimination.MethodsClinical isolates were collected from 275 P. vivax patients in 2008, 2012-2013 and 2015 in the China-Myanmar border area and from 55 patients in central China. Comparison was made with parasites from three border regions of Thailand.ResultsOverall, genetic diversity of the Pvmdr1 was relatively high in all border regions, and over the seven years in the China-Myanmar border, though slight temporal fluctuation was observed. Single nucleotide polymorphisms previously implicated in reduced chloroquine sensitivity were detected. In particular, M908L approached fixation in the China-Myanmar border area. The Y976F mutation sharply decreased from 18.5% in 2008 to 1.5% in 2012-2013 and disappeared in 2015, whereas F1076L steadily increased from 33.3% in 2008 to 77.8% in 2015. While neutrality tests suggested the action of purifying selection on the pvmdr1 gene, several likelihood-based algorithms detected positive as well as purifying selections operating on specific amino acids including M908L, T958M and F1076L. Fixation and selection of the nonsynonymous mutations are differently distributed across the three border regions and central China. Comparison with the global P. vivax populations clearly indicated clustering of haplotypes according to geographic locations. It is noteworthy that the temperate-zone parasites from central China were completely separated from the parasites from other parts of the GMS.ConclusionsThis study showed that P. vivax populations in the China-Myanmar border has experienced major changes in the Pvmdr1 residues proposed to be associated with chloroquine resistance, suggesting that drug selection may play an important role in the evolution of this gene in the parasite populations.","[Mbenda, Huguette Gaelle Ngassa; Siddiqui, Faiza Amber; Cui, Liwang] Univ S Florida, Morsani Coll Med, Dept Internal Med, Div Infect Dis & Int Med, Tampa, FL 33620 USA; [Wang, Meilian; Cao, Yaming] China Med Univ, Dept Immunol, Coll Basic Med Sci, Shenyang 110001, Peoples R China; [Guo, Jian] Shanghai East Hosp, Tongji Sch Med, Dept Lab Med, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Hu, Yue; Yang, Zhaoqing] Kunming Med Univ, Dept Pathogen Biol & Immunol, Kunming, Yunnan, Peoples R China; [Kittichai, Veerayuth; Sattabongkot, Jetsumon] Mahidol Univ, Fac Trop Med, Mahidol Vivax Res Unit, Bangkok, Thailand; [Jiang, Lubin] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Pasteur Shanghai, Unit Human Parasite Mol & Cell Biol, Key Lab Mol Virol & Immunol, Shanghai, Peoples R China","Cui, LW (corresponding author), Univ S Florida, Morsani Coll Med, Dept Internal Med, Div Infect Dis & Int Med, Tampa, FL 33620 USA.",liwangcui@usf.edu,"Kittichai, Veerayuth/AAA-7916-2021; Siddiqui, Faiza Amber/Q-2191-2015",,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious DiseasesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [U19 AI089672]; Fogarty International CenterUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH Fogarty International Center (FIC) [D43 TW006571]; National Institutes of Health, USAUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA","This study was supported by grants from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (U19 AI089672) and the Fogarty International Center (D43 TW006571), National Institutes of Health, USA.",,72,3,3,1,4,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1756-3305,,,PARASITE VECTOR,Parasites Vectors,FEB 12,2020,13,1,,,,,,,67,10.1186/s13071-020-3934-5,,,14,Parasitology; Tropical Medicine,Parasitology; Tropical Medicine,KN5HI,WOS:000514867500003,32051017,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,2021-07-18

The main approach to understanding the origins of this pervasive relationship has been study of the pollinators of living cycads, gnetaleans, and basal angiosperms [7]. Among the most morphologically specialized living pollinators are diverse, long-proboscid flies. Early such flies include the brachyceran family Zhangsolvidae, previously known only as compression fossils from the Early Cretaceous of China and Brazil. It belongs to the infraorder Stratiomyomorpha, a group that includes the flower-visiting families Xylomyidae and Stratiomyidae. New zhangsolvid specimens in amber from Spain (ca. 105 mega-annum [Ma]) and Myanmar (100 Ma) reveal a detailed proboscis structure adapted to nectivory. Pollen clumped on a specimen from Spain is Exesipollenites, attributed to a Mesozoic gymnosperm, most likely the Bennettitales. Late Mesozoic scorpionflies with a long proboscis have been proposed as specialized pollinators of various extinct gymnosperms, but pollen has never been observed on or in their bodies [8]. The new discovery is a very rare co-occurrence of pollen with its insect vector and provides substantiating evidence that other long-proboscid Mesozoic insects were gymnosperm pollinators. Evidence is thus now gathering that visitors and probable pollinators of early anthophytes, or seed plants, involved some insects with highly specialized morphological adaptations, which has consequences for interpreting the reproductive modes of Mesozoic gymnosperms and the significance of insect pollination in angiosperm success.","[Penalver, Enrique; Barron, Eduardo] Inst Geol & Minero Espana, Museo Geominero, Madrid 28003, Spain; [Arillo, Antonio] Univ Complutense, Fac Biol, Dept Zool & Antropol Fis, E-28040 Madrid, Spain; [Perez-de la Fuente, Ricardo] Harvard Univ, Museum Comparat Zool, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Riccio, Mark L.] Cornell Univ, Inst Biotechnol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Delclos, Xavier] Univ Barcelona, Fac Geol, Dept Estratig Paleontol & Geociencies Marines, E-08028 Barcelona, Spain; [Grimaldi, David A.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, New York, NY 10021 USA","Penalver, E (corresponding author), Inst Geol & Minero Espana, Museo Geominero, Madrid 28003, Spain.",e.penalver@igme.es,"DELCLOS, Xavier/N-1652-2019; DELCLOS, Xavier/D-4363-2014; Barron, Eduardo/L-4726-2014","DELCLOS, Xavier/0000-0002-2233-5480; DELCLOS, Xavier/0000-0002-2233-5480; Perez-de la Fuente, Ricardo/0000-0002-2830-2639; Barron, Eduardo/0000-0003-4979-1117; Penalver Molla, Enrique/0000-0001-8312-6087; Arillo, Antonio/0000-0002-4878-5797","IGME [491-CANOA 35015]; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness [CGL2011-23948/BTE, CGL2014-52163]; NIHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [S10OD012287]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1305066]; AMNH; OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTHUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [S10OD012287] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","We thank the El Soplao cave, SIEC S.A., and the Government of Cantabria.

The morphology of extinct and extant species is well studied, but the evolutionary history of such a broad range of adaptations is scarcely documented in the fossil record, and therefore poorly understood. One of the most puzzling specializations is that of predaceous ant-like stone beetles (Scydmaeninae), a staphylinid subfamily whose members choose not a soft-bodied prey, but the most heavily sclerotized, well-protected armoured mites. Scydmaenines have evolved a unique prey capturing apparatus with adhesive suckers to capture their prey, and the feeding process is remarkably long, often exceeding 30 h. The mouthparts with paired suckers cannot be used to catch any other kind of prey, and therefore finding such a device in extinct taxa implies specialized acarophagy. For the first time, we demonstrate that this very narrow specialization has ancient origins, and the Mesozoic (Turonian) Hyperstenichnus vendeanus Jaloszynski & Perrichot, gen. et sp. nov. from Vendean (French) amber was already an advanced, specialized mite killer. Surprisingly, the mouthpart modifications of the new species are more advanced than those in its extant relatives, suggesting that its (possibly too) narrowly specialized lineage has gone extinct. A long stasis of morphological structures is well known among Staphylinidae, and now also antiquity of narrow feeding specializations in rove beetles can be postulated, with unique habits remaining unchanged for over 90 million years.

Ten extinct and ten extant described species are classified in six genera and two families, Mymarommatidae and Gallorommatidae n. fam. A key to the families and genera is provided. Classified in Gallorommatidae is the extinct Cretaceous genus, Galloromma Schluter, including the type species, G. bezonnaisensis Schluter, and G. agapa (Kozlov and Rasnitsyn) n. comb. (from Palaeomymar). Classified in Mymarommatidae is one extinct Cretaceous genus, Archaeromma Yoshimoto, one extinct Tertiary genus, Palaeomymar Meunier, and three extant genera, Mymaromma Girault, Mymaromella Girault, and Zealaromma n. gen. Mymaromma and Mymaromella rev. stat. are resurrected from prior synonymy under Palaeomymar and a neotype male is designated for Palaeomymar succini Meunier. Protooctonus Yoshimoto is transferred from Mymaridae to Mymarommatidae and is newly synonymised under Archaeromma. Newly classified in Archaeromma are the Cretaceous species A. masneri (Yoshimoto) n. comb. (from Protooctonus), and A. mandibulatum (Kozlov and Rasnitsyn) n. comb., A. senonicum (Kozlov and Rasnitsyn) n. comb. and A. japonicum (Fursov, Shirota, Nomiya and Yamagishi) n. comb. (all from Palaeomymar). Classified in Mymaromma are M. anomalum (Blood and Kryger) rev. comb., M. buyckxi Mathot rev. comb., M. goethei Girault rev. comb., M. mirissimum (Girault) n. comb. and M. ypt (Triapitsyn and Berezovskiy) n. comb. (all from Palaeomymar). Classified in Myrmaromella is the extinct Tertiary species, M. duerrenfeldi (Schluter and Kohring) n. comb., and the extant species M. chaoi (Lin) n. comb., M. cyclopterus (Fidalgo and De Santis) n. comb. and M. mira Girault rev. comb. (all from Palaeomymar). Classified in Zealaromma are the newly designated type species of the genus, Z. insulare (Valentine) n. comb. (from Palaeomymar) and Z. valentinei n. sp. Description of the structural diversity of extant and extinct mymarommatids is based on the 20 described species plus 15 undescribed extant morphospecies and several fossils from Tertiary Baltic amber and Burmese, Canadian and New Jersey Cretaceous amber. Evidence for monophyly of the genera is presented and the following phylogenetic relationships are hypothesized: Galloromma + (Archaeromma + (Zealaromma + (Mymaromella + (Palaeomymar + Mymaromma)))). Absence of mesotibial and metatibial spurs are newly proposed synapomorphies for Mymarommatoidea. New information is given on the structure of Serphitidae (Serphitoidea) based on study of several Taimyr and Canadian Cretaceous fossils, and structural features that are shared among Serphitoidea, Mymarommatoidea, Chalcidoidea and Platygastroidea are discussed relative to establishing their relationships. Several features, including gastral laterotergites, a mesopectal region similar to a netrion, and a forewing venation that could be ancestral to that of Platygastroidea suggest Serphitoidea is closely related to Platygastroidea. No new evidence was found to support a Serphitoidea + Mymarommatoidea sister-group relationship. Independent parameres in the groundplan of the male genitalia of Mymarommatoidea and Serphitoidea is a likely symplesiomorphy that differentiates them from Chalcidoidea and Platygastroidea. Two different types of specialized claval sensilla could support monophyly of Mymarommatoidea + Chalcidoidea, but further study throughout parasitic Hymenoptera is necessary to substantiate character-state distribution and homology.","Agr & Agri Food Canada, Ottawa, ON K1A 0C6, Canada; Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forestry Serv, ECORC, Ottawa, ON K1A 0C6, Canada","Gibson, GAP (corresponding author), Agr & Agri Food Canada, KW Neatby Bldg,960 Carling Ave, Ottawa, ON K1A 0C6, Canada.",gibsong@agr.gc.ca,,,,,,94,40,49,0,10,PENSOFT PUBL,SOFIA,"GEO MILEV STR 13A, SOFIA, 1111, BULGARIA",1070-9428,,,J HYMENOPT RES,J.

Little has been known about their early diversification, character evolution, phylogeny and historical biogeography because of limited fossil material and lack of a phylogeny integrating extant and extinct representatives. Here we report an unexpectedly diverse dasycerine fauna from the mid-Cretaceous of northern Myanmar, including a new genus and four new species. To reconstruct the early evolutionary history of Dasycerinae, we present a phylogenetic framework of the subfamily based on a dataset integrating all extant and extinct taxa using parsimony, maximum-likelihood and Bayesian methods. dagger Cedasyrusgen. n., characterized by distinct sexual dimorphism in antennal and elytral lengths, is recovered as the basal-most lineage, sister to the remaining two extinct genera and all livingDasycerusspecies. dagger Vetudasycerusis recovered as sister to dagger Protodasycerus + Dasycerus. Among all extinct taxa, dagger Protodasycerusbears distinctly longer elytra, and appears to represent a transitional form from dagger VetudasycerustoDasycerus. Phylogenetic inferences and ancestral distribution reconstruction support an Out-of-Orient model for Dasycerinae. Either the Bering- or North Atlantic Land Bridge may have served as a passageway for dasycerine dispersal between Eurasian and North American continents. An elevation-reconstruction analysis indicated that the ancestor of the extantDasycerusprobably lived at a high altitude and stayed at this elevation through the end of the Miocene. We propose that the extinction of dasycerine ancestors living on the Tethyan islands at low altitude was likely caused by sea-level rise and climatic warming during the Late Cretaceous. The high-altitude areas might have played the role of refugia that harboured subalpine derivatives which eventually gave rise to the extantDasycerus.","[Yin, Zi-Wei] Shanghai Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Lab Systemat Entomol, Shanghai 200234, Peoples R China; [Lu, Liang] Hebei Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Key Lab Anim Physiol Biochem & Mol Biol Hebei Pro, Shijiazhuang 050024, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Yamamoto, Shuhei; Thayer, Margaret K.; Newton, Alfred F.] Field Museum Nat Hist, Integrat Res Ctr, 1400 S Lake Shore Dr,7, Chicago, IL 60605 USA; [Cai, Chen-Yang] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Cai, Chen-Yang] Univ Bristol, Sch Earth Sci, Life Sci Bldg,Tyndall Ave, Bristol BS8 1TQ, Avon, England","Yin, ZW (corresponding author), Shanghai Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Lab Systemat Entomol, Shanghai 200234, Peoples R China.; Lu, L (corresponding author), Hebei Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Key Lab Anim Physiol Biochem & Mol Biol Hebei Pro, Shijiazhuang 050024, Hebei, Peoples R China.",pselaphinae@gmail.com; lianges.luex@gmail.com,"Yamamoto, Shuhei/U-8247-2018","Yamamoto, Shuhei/0000-0002-4162-8457; Lu, Liang/0000-0001-7533-6244","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31872965, 31501883]; Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB26000000]; Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research [2019QZKK0706]; Natural Science Foundation of Hebei ProvinceNatural Science Foundation of Hebei Province [C2018205123]; Shanghai Phosphor Science Foundation, China [19QA1406600]; JSPS (Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, Tokyo, Japan) Overseas Research FellowshipMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [29-212]","We thank David Maddison (OSAC) for providing additional fossil material used in the study.

With a multigene dataset as the basis for a comprehensive gekkotan phylogeny, model-based methods have recently been employed to estimate the number of unique derivations of the adhesive system and its role in lineage diversification. Evidence points to a single basal origin of the spinulate oberhautchen layer of the epidermis, which is a necessary precursor for the subsequent elaboration of a functional adhesive mechanism in geckos. However, multiple gains and losses are implicated for the elaborated setae that are necessary for adhesion via van der Waals forces. The well-supported phylogeny of gekkotans has demonstrated that convergence and parallelism in digital design are even more prevalent than previously believed. It also permits the reexamination of previously collected morphological data in an explicitly evolutionary context. Both time-calibrated trees and recently discovered amber fossils that preserve gecko toepads suggest that a fully-functional adhesive apparatus was not only present, but also represented by diverse architectures, by the mid-Cretaceous. Further characterization and phylogenetically-informed analyses of the other components of the adhesive system (muscles, tendons, blood sinuses, etc.) will permit a more comprehensive reconstruction of the evolutionary pathway(s) by which geckos have achieved their structural and taxonomic diversity. A phylogenetic perspective can meaningfully inform functional and performance studies of gecko adhesion and locomotion and can contribute to advances in bioinspired materials.","[Bauer, A.

Mutations in the Kelch propeller domain of PfK13 are the only known molecular markers for artemisinin resistance in this parasite. Over 100 non-synonymous mutations have been identified in PfK13 from various malaria endemic regions. This study aimed to investigate the genetic diversity of PvK12, the Plasmodium vivax ortholog of PfK13, in parasite populations from Southeast Asia, where artemisinin resistance in P. falciparum has emerged. Methods: The PvK12 sequences in 120 P. vivax isolates collected from Thailand (22), Myanmar (32) and China (66) between 2004 and 2008 were obtained and 353 PvK12 sequences from worldwide populations were retrieved for further analysis. Results: These PvK12 sequences revealed a very low level of genetic diversity (pi = 0.00003) with only three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Of these three SNPs, only G581R is nonsynonymous. The synonymous mutation S88S is present in 3% (1/32) of the Myanmar samples, while G704G and G581R are present in 1.5% (1/66) and 3% (2/66) of the samples from China, respectively. None of the mutations observed in the P. vivax samples were associated with artemisinin resistance in P. falciparum. Furthermore, analysis of 473 PvK12 sequences from twelve worldwide P. vivax populations confirmed the very limited polymorphism in this gene and detected only five distinct haplotypes. Conclusions: The PvK12 sequences from global P. vivax populations displayed very limited genetic diversity indicating low levels of baseline polymorphisms of PvK12 in these areas.","[Wang, Meilian; Luo, Enjie; Cui, Liwang] China Med Univ, Dept Microbiol & Parasitol, Coll Basic Med Sci, 77 Puhe Rd, Shenyang 110013, Peoples R China; [Wang, Meilian; Siddiqui, Faiza Amber; Cui, Liwang] Penn State Univ, Dept Entomol, 501 ASI Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA; [Fan, Qi] Dalian Inst Biotechnol, Dalian, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Cao, Yaming] China Med Univ, Dept Immunol, Coll Basic Med Sci, 77 Puhe Rd, Shenyang 110013, Peoples R China","Wang, ML; Cui, LW (corresponding author), China Med Univ, Dept Microbiol & Parasitol, Coll Basic Med Sci, 77 Puhe Rd, Shenyang 110013, Peoples R China.; Wang, ML; Cui, LW (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Entomol, 501 ASI Bldg, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",Wangmeilian_m@hotmail.com; luc2@psu.edu,"Siddiqui, Faiza Amber/Q-2191-2015","Siddiqui, Faiza Amber/0000-0003-0089-7455","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [81501769]; Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning ProvinceNatural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province [2013021010]; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of HealthUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [U19 AI089672]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [U19AI089672] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 81501769), a grant from Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province (No. 2013021010), and a grant from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health (U19 AI089672).

The specialized mouthparts of berstids indicate that they were predaceous on small arthropods. Their striking beetle-like appearance implies that they were either involved in defensive mimicry or mimicked beetles to attack unsuspecting prey.

We used here a total-evidence approach (by tip-dating) employing 174 morphological characters of 73 Recent and 43 fossil taxa (48 families) and DNA sequences of three gene regions, to obtain divergence time estimates and compare the chronology of the most diverse lineage of scale insects, the neococcoid families, with the timing of the main angiosperm radiation. An estimated origin of the Coccomorpha occurred at the beginning of the Triassic, about 245 Ma [228-273], and of the neococcoids 60 million years later [210-165 Ma]. A total-evidence approach allows the integration of extinct scale insects into a phylogenetic framework, resulting in slightly younger median estimates than analyses using Recent taxa, calibrated with fossil ages only. From these estimates, we hypothesise that most major lineages of coccoids shifted from gymnosperms onto angiosperms when the latter became diverse and abundant in the mid-to Late Cretaceous.","[Vea, Isabelle M.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Richard Gilder Grad Sch, Cent Pk West 79th St, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Vea, Isabelle M.; Grimaldi, David A.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, Cent Pk West 79th St, New York, NY 10024 USA","Vea, IM (corresponding author), Amer Museum Nat Hist, Richard Gilder Grad Sch, Cent Pk West 79th St, New York, NY 10024 USA.; Vea, IM (corresponding author), Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, Cent Pk West 79th St, New York, NY 10024 USA.",isabelle.vea@gmail.com,"Vea, Isabelle/K-1618-2015","Vea, Isabelle/0000-0001-9351-7970","AMNH; Richard Gilder Graduate School, AMNH; Theodore Roosevelt grant from the AMNH; Entomological Society of America SysEB section Travel Award; U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF); NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [1209870]","We are thankful for colleagues that kindly sent us fresh material for sequencing: Yu Matsuura, Manpreet Dhami, Ewa Simon and Malgorzata Kalandyk-Kolodziejczyk, Ian Stocks, Helene Dumas, Daniele Matile-Ferrero, Timothee Le Pechon, Michelle Cram.

Despite the recently increasing rate of fossil research focused on the click-beetles (Coleoptera: Elateridae), the major group in the superfamily Elateroidea, their palaeodiversity has still remained largely understudied. In this study, we summarized current knowledge on the click-beetle fossil record with a main emphasis on the described diversity. We compiled an annotated catalogue of all described fossil species in Elateridae, assessed the reliability of their systematic placement, and discuss the current state of knowledge and prospects of research of the fossil record in the group. This study should serve as a comprehensive basis for all subsequent research dealing with the origin, early evolution and diversity of Elateridae. The Elateridae (click-beetles) are the largest family in Elateroidea; however, their relationships, systematics and classification remain unclear. Our understanding of the origin, evolution, palaeodiversity and palaeobiogeography of Elateridae, as well as reconstruction of a reliable time-calibrated phylogeny for the group, are hampered by the lack of detailed knowledge of their fossil record. In this study, we summarize the current knowledge on all described fossil species in Elateridae, including their type material, geographic origin, age, bibliography and remarks on their systematic placement. Altogether, 261 fossil species classified in 99 genera and nine subfamilies are currently listed in this family. The Mesozoic click-beetle diversity includes 143 species, with most of them described from the Jurassic Karatau, and 118 described species are known from the Cenozoic deposits, mainly from the Eocene North American Florissant Formation and European Baltic amber. Available data on the described past diversity of Elateridae suggest that almost all fossil lineages in this group are in urgent need of revision and numerous Mesozoic species might belong to different families. Our study is intended to serve as a comprehensive basis for all subsequent research focused on the click-beetle fossil record.","[Kundrata, Robin; Packova, Gabriela; Hoffmannova, Johana] Palacky Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, 17 Listopadu 50, Olomouc 77146, Czech Republic; [Prosvirov, Alexander S.] Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Fac Biol, Dept Entomol, Leninskie Gory 1-12, Moscow 119234, Russia","Kundrata, R (corresponding author), Palacky Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, 17 Listopadu 50, Olomouc 77146, Czech Republic.",robin.kundrata@upol.cz; gabriela.packova01@upol.cz; carrabus69@mail.ru; johana.hoffmannova01@upol.cz,,"Prosvirov, Alexander/0000-0002-1415-548X; Kundrata, Robin/0000-0001-9397-1030",Palacky University [IGA_PrF_2021_019]; Moscow State University; Moscow State University [AAAA-A16-116021660095-7],"This research was funded by the internal grant of the Palacky University nr.

Maculaferrum blaisi is part of a new collection assembled during recent fieldwork in the Redmond Formation, Labrador, Canada, near Schefferville. It consists in a single isolated forewing whose venational characters allow a classification to Tettigarctinae at the subfamily level. Classification at a higher level remains uncertain since it displays a combination of characters supposedly unique to tribes Protabanini, Meunierini, and Tettigarctini. Thus, this discovery adds credence to suggestions of a revision of the definitions of these tribes since they seem to be based on many convergent or plesiomorphic characters. Remnants of a spotted pattern on the wing membrane and probable setae along some veins are also preserved. Observations of the holotype's fine anatomical characters have been facilitated by the use of Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI), an emerging method for the visualization of compression and impression fossils. Considering that the estimated age of the Redmond Formation is the Cenomanian (Late Cretaceous), the discovery of Al blaisi contributes to a very recent expansion of the tettigarctid fossil record that fills a gap between Early Cretaceous and Cenozoic genera. It suggests that hairy cicadas maintained a global distribution and thrived in a variety of climate regimes well into the Late Cretaceous, and that their competitive exclusion by singing cicadas occurred definitely closer to the end of the Cretaceous, or even during the Cenozoic. This discovery is only the start of a thorough description of the recently expanded entomofauna in the Cretaceous of Labrador.","[Demers-Potvin, Alexandre, V; Larsson, Hans C.

Its possible function remains, however, a matter of discussion. Even during very recent studies, no conclusion has been reached. As suggested in these recent publications, the lack of or reduction of fluorescence could be a useful tool to explain the phenomenon. It is suggested here that, in at least some species of the family Chaerilidae Simon, this phenomenon is absent. This new discovery may initiate important comparative eco-physiological studies.

There has been minimal molecular research on the family and as a result little understanding of the evolutionary relationships within the group. We present the first molecular phylogeny focused on Gasteruptiidae, generated using three molecular fragments (mitochondrial C01 and nuclear markers EF1- a and 28s) and estimate the divergence times of Evanioidea based on three secondary calibration points. The analyses included 142 specimens of Gasteruptiidae and 5 outgroup taxa from Aulacidae and Evaniidae. The monophyly of the Gasteruptiidae and its subfamilies Gasteruptiinae (Gasteruption) and Hyptiogastrinae (Hyptiogaster and Pseudofoenus) are confirmed. Our results indicate that Evanioidea diverged during the late Jurassic at 151.3 (171.99-136.15) Ma with Evaniidae during the early Cretaceous at 137.33 (140.86-133.67) Ma, and Gasteruptiidae during the Palaeocene at 60.23 ( 83.78-40.02) Ma. The crown age of Hyptiogastrinae was estimated to be during the mid-Eocene 40.72 (60.9-22.57) Ma and for Gasteruption during the early Eocene at 47.46 (64.7-31.75) Ma, which corresponded to their host divergence ages.

The ancestral elytral length of the family and of this subfamily have long been debated. We present a phylogenetic analysis of Omaliinae based on partial mitochondrial COI (1488 bp), COII (366 bp), 12S rDNA (353 bp), nuclear 18S rDNA (1814 bp), 28S rDNA (876 bp) and CAD (869 bp) data. In all, 51 species in 31 genera and four outgroup species were included. The concatenated sequences were analysed by both parsimony- and model-based (Bayesian and maximum likelihood) methods. The subfamily Omaliinae was not supported as a monophyletic group. The model-based analyses (Bayesian and maximum likelihood trees) showed Empelinae nested within Omaliinae (excluding Corneolabiini), whereas parsimony analysis found all three putative ingroup subfamilies, Empelinae, Glypholomatinae and Microsilphinae, grouped within Omaliinae. Within the Omaliinae, the tribes Coryphiini and Eusphalerini were each supported as monophyletic, whereas Anthophagini and Omaliini were each nonmonophyletic. We hypothesize that there have been at least four independent origins of long elytra from short elytra in the omaliine lineage.","[Kim, Tae-Kyu] Natl Res Inst Hlth, Div Med Entomol, Cheongju, South Korea; [Song, Jeong-Hun; Ahn, Kee-Jeong] Chungnam Natl Univ, Dept Biol, Daejeon 34134, South Korea; [Thayer, Margaret K.] Field Museum Nat Hist, Integrat Res Ctr, Chicago, IL 60605 USA; [Song, Jeong-Hun] Rural Dev Adm, Natl Inst Agr Sci, Dept Agr Biol, Ind Insect Div, Wonju 55365, South Korea","Ahn, KJ (corresponding author), Chungnam Natl Univ, Dept Biol, Daejeon 34134, South Korea.",kjahn@cnu.ac.kr,,"Thayer, Margaret/0000-0003-0061-9981",,,,75,6,7,1,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-6970,1365-3113,,SYST ENTOMOL,Syst.

The taxonomic interpretation of three fossil species from the Caenozoic is reconsidered. It is shown that the genus Miocyphon Wickham, 1914 can be scarcely regarded as a close relative of representatives of either Dascillidae or Scirtidae. 'Phenolia' incapax Scudder, 1890 and Lithomacratria Wickham, 1914 are regarded here without family attribution, the first as a member of Cucujiformia (i.e., out of Nitidulidae) and the latter as a member of the superfamily Tenebrionoidea (i.e., out of both Anthicidae and Pyrochroidae).","[Kirejtshuk, Alexander G.] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Univ Skaya Emb 1, St Petersburg 199034, Russia; [Kirejtshuk, Alexander G.] Museum Natl Hist Nat, CNRS, UMR 7205, Entomol, CP 50,45 Rue Buffon, F-75005 Paris, France; [Ponomarenko, Alexander G.; Alexeev, Anatoly V.; Gratshev, Vadim G.] Russian Acad Sci, Palaeontol Inst, Profsoyuznaya Str 123, Moscow 117647, Russia; [Kurochkin, Andrey S.] Samara Natl Res Univ, Moskovskoye Shosse 34, Samara 443086, Russia; [Solodovnikov, Alexey Yu.] Univ Copenhagen, Nat Hist Museum Denmark, Zool Museum, Univ Pk 15, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Krell, Frank-Thorsten] Denver Museum Nat & Sci, Dept Zool, 2001 Colorado Blvd, Denver, CO 80205 USA; [Soriano, Carmen] Argonne Natl Lab, Adv Photon Source, 431-B002,9700 S Cass Ave, Lemont, IL 60439 USA","Kirejtshuk, AG (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Univ Skaya Emb 1, St Petersburg 199034, Russia.; Kirejtshuk, AG (corresponding author), Museum Natl Hist Nat, CNRS, UMR 7205, Entomol, CP 50,45 Rue Buffon, F-75005 Paris, France.",agk@zin.ru,,"soriano, carmen/0000-0003-3963-3393","INTAS projectINTAS [03-51-4367]; Presidium of the Russian Academy of SciencesRussian Academy of Sciences; Russian Foundation of Basic ResearchRussian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR) [12-04-00663-a, 18-04-00243-a, 19-04-00465-a]; US NSF PEET [00118749];  [AAAA-A17-117030310210-3]","This paper contributes to the INTAS project 03-51-4367, which was initiated by A.

In this paper we identify two rapid desertification events (RDEs) at similar to 4.6 +/- 0.2 ka BP and similar to 3.3 +/- 0.2 ka BP from the JJ Profile, located in the eastern Mu Us Sandy Lands. These RDEs appear to have occurred immediately following periods marked by persistently frequent and intense fires. We argue that such fire patterns, directly linked to an uncontrolled human use of vegetation as fuel, played a key role in accelerating RDEs by ensuring that the land surface was degraded beyond the threshold required for rapid desertification. This would suggest that the future use of a massive and sustained ecological program of vegetation rehabilitation should reduce the risk of destructive fire.","[Miao, Yunfa; Jin, Heling] Chinese Acad Sci, Cold & Arid Reg Environm & Engn Inst, Key Lab Desert & Desertificat, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China; [Cui, Jianxin] Shaanxi Normal Univ, Northwest Inst Hist Environm & Socioecon Dev, Xian 710062, Peoples R China","Miao, YF (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Cold & Arid Reg Environm & Engn Inst, Key Lab Desert & Desertificat, Lanzhou 730000, Peoples R China.",miaoyunfa@lzb.ac.cn,,,"National Basic Research Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2012CB821903]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41222013, 91114201]; Outstanding Youth Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK2012049]; Grant Agency of the Czech RepublicGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [14-03847J]; bilateral project funding French CNRS-China Academy of Science; Lebanese University","We thank the President and Fellows of Harvard College for permission to use MCZ copyrighted material; the Willi Hennig Society for the use of the TNT software; and the ANKA Synchrotron Radiation Facility for providing beam time.

Reconstructing the evolutionary history of these lineages is challenging, especially with respect to dating major events. Here, a new genus and species of Passalidae, Protopassalus araripensis gen. et sp. nov., is described based on a well-preserved fossil in laminated limestone from the Crato Formation (Santana Group, Lower Cretaceous, upper Aptian), collected in a quarry near Nova Olinda, Chapada do Araripe, State of Ceara, Brazil. This specimen is the oldest passalid fossil and the first record for the family in the Santana Group, and aids in understanding the origin and radiation of terrestrial Coleoptera. Protopassalus araripensis gen. et sp. nov. shows characteristics of the subfamily Passalinae, representing the oldest record of this group and suggesting that the family emerged over 150 Ma. The new genus is attributed to this subfamily based on: outline of head and eyes with strongly convex frontal area, posteriorly grooved and curve, with incomplete central tubercle; pronotum rounded at sides with longitudinal groove; mesothorax with narrowing connection with abdomen, dorsally evident; elytra longitudinally striated and with similar dorsal striae and interstriae.

Herein, an extensive taxonomic review of Procercopidae is presented and some new fossils are reported from the Lower Cretaceous Yixian Formation of NE China. As a result, Chengdecercopis Hong, 1983 is transferred from Procercopidae to Sinoalidae; Procercopis longipennis Becker-Migdisova, 1962 and P shawanensis Zhang, Wang and Zhang, 2003 are transferred to Procercopina Martynov, 1937, resulting in Procercopina longipennis (Becker-Migdisova, 1962), comb. n. and P shawanensis (Zhang, Wang and Zhang, 2003), comb. n.; Luanpingia senjituensis Hong, 1984 is transferred to Stellularis Chen, Yao and Ren, 2015, leading to Stellulari senjituensis (Hong, 1984), comb. n.; Anthoscytina macula Hu, Yao and Ren, 2014 is transferred to Sinocercopis Hong, 1982, and Sunoscytinopteris (Scytinopteridae) and Cathaycixius (Cixiidae) are treated as junior homonym names of Sinocercopis, leading to Sinocercopis macula (Hu, Yao and Ren, 2014), comb. n., S lushangfenensis (Hong, 1984), comb. n., S pustulosis (Ren, 1995), comb. n., and S trinervis (Ren, 1995), comb. n. Additionally, two new species are erected: Stellularis bineuris Chen and Wang, sp. n. and S minutus Chen and Wang, sp. n. Our cladistic analysis based on wing (tegmen and hind wing) characteristics recovers the high-level relationships within Cercopoidea: Sinoalidae + (Procercopidae + (Cercopionidae + modern cercopoids)). Within the family Procercopidae, the cladistic analysis reveals that the Middle to Late Jurassic Titanocercopis and Jurocercopis and the Cretaceous Cretocercopis occupy the basal position, and a gradual change in wing venation can be recognized from the Early Jurassic Procercopis and Procercopina to the Jurassic Anthoscytina, and then to the Cretaceous Stellularis and Sinocercopis. The two Cretaceous genera, sharing wing traits with extant cercopoids, likely represent transitional forms between Procercopidae and recent Cercopoidea; however, they are very similar to their Jurassic relatives in body structures, suggesting it is applicable to attribute them to Procercopidae. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that the extinction of Procercopidae and the origin and early diversification of modern Cercopoidea approximately coincided with the rise and explosive radiation of angiosperms in the late Early Cretaceous and onwards.","[Chen, Jun; Zheng, Yan; Zhang, Junqiang; An, Baizheng; Wang, Xiaoli] Linyi Univ, Inst Geol & Paleontol, Linyi, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Chen, Jun; Wang, Bo; Zheng, Yan; Jiang, Hui; Zhang, Haichun] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Chen, Jun; Wang, Bo; Zheng, Yan; Jiang, Hui; Zhang, Haichun] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Hui] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Tian] China Univ Geosci, State Key Lab Biogeol & Environm Geol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Bozdogan, Hakan] Ahi Evran Univ, Tech Vocat Sch Kirsehir, Dept Herbal & Anim Prod, Kirsehir, Turkey","Chen, J; Zhang, HC (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Chen, J; Zhang, HC (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",rubiscada@sina.com; bowang@nigpas.ac.cn; zhengyan536@163.com; huijiang@nigpas.ac.cn; jiangtian@cugb.edu.cn; hakan.bozdogan@ahievran.edu.tr; zhangjunqiang@lyu.edu.cn; an_baizheng@126.com; wangxiaoli@lyu.edu.cn; hczhang@nigpas.ac.cn,"Xiaoli, Wang/H-1079-2014; BOZDOGAN, HAKAN/K-1400-2018","BOZDOGAN, HAKAN/0000-0002-6836-4383","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41502007, 41472023, 41702012, 41572010, 41622201, 41688103]; State Key Laboratory of Palaeobiology and Stratigraphy (Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, CAS)Chinese Academy of Sciences [183105]; Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB26000000]","The study was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (41502007; 41472023; 41702012; 41572010; 41622201; 41688103); State Key Laboratory of Palaeobiology and Stratigraphy (Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, CAS) (No. 183105); and Strategic Priority Research Program (B) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDB26000000).",,77,5,7,1,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0947-5745,1439-0469,,J ZOOL SYST EVOL RES,J.

Their phylogenetic assignment is problematic because of fragmentary preservation, yet crucial for the correct use of the information they provide. Here an analysis is presented of the phylogenetic position of Leehermania prorova, the Late Triassic compressed fossil which was described and hitherto widely used as the oldest representative of Staphylinidae (rove beetles) in the suborder Polyphaga. By contrast with the intuitive character assessment made in the original description, a phylogenetic analysis of Leehermania is performed using an extensive morphological matrix of extant Coleoptera provided by the Beetle Tree of Life project, constrained in view of the latest relevant molecular phylogenies. As a result, Leehermania is identified as an extinct lineage within the beetle suborder Myxophaga, closest to the modern family Hydroscaphidae. Excluding Leehermania from Staphylinidae and placing it in Myxophaga amends erroneous assumptions about early diversification of rove beetles and enhances our views of the evolutionary history of Coleoptera.","[Fikacek, Martin] Natl Museum, Dept Zool, Prague 9, Czech Republic; [Fikacek, Martin] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, Prague 2, Czech Republic; [Beutel, Rolf G.] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Zool & Evolut Forsch, Jena, Germany; [Cai, Chenyang] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Cai, Chenyang] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Cai, Chenyang] Univ Bristol, Sch Earth Sci, Bristol, Avon, England; [Lawrence, John F.; Slipinski, Adam] Australian Natl Insect Collect, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Newton, Alfred F.; Thayer, Margaret K.; Yamamoto, Shuhei] Field Museum Nat Hist, Integrat Res Ctr, Chicago, IL 60605 USA; [Solodovnikov, Alexey] Zool Museum, Nat Hist Museum Denmark, Copenhagen, Denmark","Fikacek, M (corresponding author), Natl Museum, Dept Entomol, Cirkusova 1740, Prague 19100 9, Czech Republic.",mfikacek@gmail.com,"Slipinski, Adam/AAZ-2485-2020; Slipinski, Stanislaw Adam/B-4293-2009; Yamamoto, Shuhei/U-8247-2018","Slipinski, Adam/0000-0002-1216-8068; Yamamoto, Shuhei/0000-0002-4162-8457; Thayer, Margaret/0000-0003-0061-9981","Ministry of Culture of the Czech Republic [DKRVO 2019-2023/5.I.a, 00023272]; Charles University Research Centre program [204069]; Ministry of Science and Technology [2016YFC0600406, 2015FY310100]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB26000000]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41730317]; Bureau of Geological Survey of China; National Committee of Stratigraphy of China [DD20160120-04]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Overseas Research FellowshipMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [29-212]","This project was funded by: the Ministry of Culture of the Czech Republic (DKRVO 2019-2023/5.I.a, National Museum, 00023272) and by Charles University Research Centre program No. 204069 (MF); Ministry of Science and Technology (2016YFC0600406, 2015FY310100) and the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDB26000000) (CAS); the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41730317) and the Bureau of Geological Survey of China and the National Committee of Stratigraphy of China (DD20160120-04) (CC); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Overseas Research Fellowship (29-212) (SY).",,68,14,15,1,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-6970,1365-3113,,SYST ENTOMOL,Syst.

We emphasize that the fossil record of chelicerates is more complete than is sometimes assumed, and that paleontology plays a key role in dating cladogenesis by setting minimum divergence times, which can and do falsify molecular clock estimates where the inferred divergence is substantially younger than the known fossil record. The oldest representatives of each chelicerate order are documented here, together with similar data for the major mite lineages down to family level.

Owing to interest in harvestman diversity, evolution and biogeography, their relationships have been thoroughly studied using morphology and PCR-based Sanger approaches to infer their systematic relationships. More recently, two studies utilized transcriptomics-based phylogenomics to explore their basal relationships and diversification, but sampling was limiting for understanding deep evolutionary patterns, as they lacked good taxon representation at the family level. Here, we analysed a set of the 14 existing transcriptomes with 40 additional ones generated for this study, representing approximately 80% of the extant familial diversity in Opiliones. Our phylogenetic analyses, including a set of data matrices with different gene occupancy and evolutionary rates, and using a multitude of methods correcting for a diversity of factors affecting phylogenomic data matrices, provide a robust and stable Opiliones tree of life, where most families and higher taxa are precisely placed. Our dating analyses using alternative calibration points, methods and analytical parameters provide well-resolvedold divergences, consistent with ancient regionalization in Pangea in some groups, and Pangean vicariance in others. The integration of state-of-the-art molecular techniques and analyses, together with the broadest taxonomic sampling to date presented in a phylogenomic study of harvestmen, provide new insights into harvestmen interrelationships, as well as an overview of the general biogeographic patterns of this ancient arthropod group.","[Fernandez, Rosa; Tourinho, Ana Lucia; Giribet, Gonzalo] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Museum Comparat Zool, 26 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Sharma, Prashant P.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Zool, 352 Birge Hall,430 Lincoln Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Tourinho, Ana Lucia] Inst Nacl Pesquisas Amazon, CBIO, Avenida Andre Araujo,2936, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil","Fernandez, R; Giribet, G (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Museum Comparat Zool, 26 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",rfernandezgarcia@g.harvard.edu; ggiribet@g.harvard.edu,"Fernandez, Rosa/AAR-5567-2021; Tourinho, Ana Lucia/G-3598-2012; Giribet, Gonzalo/P-1086-2015; Fernandez, Rosa/Q-2294-2016","Fernandez, Rosa/0000-0002-4719-6640; Tourinho, Ana Lucia/0000-0001-8335-328X; Giribet, Gonzalo/0000-0002-5467-8429; Fernandez, Rosa/0000-0002-4719-6640","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB1457539, DBI-1202751]; National GeographicNational Geographic Society [9043-11]; International Postdoctoral [CNPq 200972/2013-8]; MCZ; CAPES/PVECoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [AUX-PE-PVES 2510/2012]; Division Of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1457539] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","The following funding sources were used: NSF grant DEB1457539 (G.G.); National Geographic grant no. 9043-11 (G.G.); International Postdoctoral grant no.

This makes it challenging to study the evolutionary transition that led to the evolution of parasitism in different taxa. Most studies on the evolution of parasites are based on phylogenies of extant species that were constructed based on morphological and molecular data, but they give us an incomplete picture and offer little information on many important details of parasite-host interactions. The lack of fossil parasites also means we know very little about the roles that parasites played in ecosystems of the past even though it is known that parasites have significant influences on many ecosystems. The goal of this review is to bring attention to known fossils of parasites and parasitism, and provide a conceptual framework for how research on fossil parasites can develop in the future. Despite their rarity, there are some fossil parasites which have been described from different geological eras. These fossils include the free-living stage of parasites, parasites which became fossilised with their hosts, parasite eggs and propagules in coprolites, and traces of pathology inflicted by parasites on the host's body. Judging from the fossil record, while there were some parasite-host relationships which no longer exist in the present day, many parasite taxa which are known from the fossil record seem to have remained relatively unchanged in their general morphology and their patterns of host association over tens or even hundreds of millions of years. It also appears that major evolutionary and ecological transitions throughout the history of life on Earth coincided with the appearance of certain parasite taxa, as the appearance of new host groups also provided new niches for potential parasites. As such, fossil parasites can provide additional data regarding the ecology of their extinct hosts, since many parasites have specific life cycles and transmission modes which reflect certain aspects of the host's ecology. The study of fossil parasites can be conducted using existing techniques in palaeontology and palaeoecology, and microscopic examination of potential material such as coprolites may uncover more fossil evidence of parasitism. However, I also urge caution when interpreting fossils as examples of parasites or parasitism-induced traces. I point out a number of cases where parasitism has been spuriously attributed to some fossil specimens which, upon re-examination, display traits which are just as (if not more) likely to be found in free-living taxa. The study of parasite fossils can provide a more complete picture of the ecosystems and evolution of life throughout Earth's history.","[Leung, Tommy L.

Recent phylogenetic studies suggest a sister relationship of Diochini and a lineage formed by Xantholinini, Maorothiini, and Othiini, within the subfamily Staphylininae. Here, we describe the first known endogean representative of Diochini, Diochus occultus n. sp., and provide the first two complete mitogenomes for the tribe, corresponding to the two European Diochus species: Diochus occultus n. sp. and Diochus staudingeri. These sequences were combined with 40 additional mitogenomes from representatives within Staphylininae, Paederinae, Silphidae, and Aleocharinae, and COI sequences from 5 additional species of Diochus to conduct a series of mitogenomic phylogenetic and dating analyses. The estimated molecular phylogeny is fully consistent with previous studies based on morphology and molecular data, finding a sister relationship of Diochini with a clade formed by Xantholinini and Othiini (Maorothiini not sampled). Dating analyses inferred an early split of the tribe Diochini at 140-156 Mya. Morphology shows clear differences in the aedeagal and external morphology of D. occultus n. sp. and D. staudingeri, whereas a sister relationship of these taxa is found in the phylogenetic analyses, with the split dated at 48-61 Mya. Although the study of additional Palaearctic Diochus species will be required to conclusively establish that D. occultus n. sp. is a palaeoendemic taxon sister to D. staudingeri, associated with forests of Abies pinsapo in the south of the Iberian Peninsula, this conclusion is consistent with the ancient estimated age of speciation, endogean habitat specificity, low dispersal capacity (flightless species), and microendemicity of D. occultus. This is also consistent with the continued emersion of the Betic sub-plate along its tectonic evolution. The estimated ages of diversification of the Paederinae-Staphylininae lineage are also discussed.","[Hernando, Carles] POB 118, E-08911 Badalona, Catalonia, Spain; [Andujar, Carmelo] CSIC, Isl Ecol & Evolut Res Grp, Inst Prod Nat & Agrobiol IPNA, San Cristobal la Laguna, Spain","Andujar, C (corresponding author), CSIC, Isl Ecol & Evolut Res Grp, Inst Prod Nat & Agrobiol IPNA, Tenerife 38206, Canary Islands, Spain.",candujar@ipna.csic.es,"Andujar, Carmelo/AAA-7548-2020","Andujar, Carmelo/0000-0001-9759-7402",Ministerio de Economia y CompetitividadSpanish Government [CGL2015-74178-JIN],"Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Grant/Award Number: CGL2015-74178-JIN",,77,0,0,3,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0947-5745,1439-0469,,J ZOOL SYST EVOL RES,J.

Actinomorphic flowers with eight to ten perianth parts are described and evaluated in a phylogenetic framework. The goal of this study is to determine the identity of these fossil flowers and to discuss their evolutionary, palaeoecological and biogeographical significance Methods More than 100 fossilized flowers were collected from three localities in the Danian Salamanca and Penas Coloradas Formations in southern Chubut. They were prepared, photographed and compared with similar extant and fossil flowers using published literature and herbarium specimens. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using morphological and molecular data. Key results The fossil flowers share some but not all the synapomorphies that characterize the Schizomerieae, a tribe within Cunoniaceae. These features include the shallow floral cup, variable number of perianth parts arranged in two whorls, laciniate petals, anthers with a connective extension, and a superior ovary with free styles. The number of perianth parts is doubled and the in situ pollen is tricolporate, with a surface more like that of other Cunoniaceae outside Schizomerieae. such as Davidsonia or Weinmannia. Conclusions An extinct genus of crown-group Cunoniaceae is recognized and placed along the stem lineage leading to Schizomerieae. Extant relatives are typical of tropical to southern-temperate rainforests, and these fossils likely indicate a similarly warm and wet temperate palaeoclimate. The oldest reliable occurrences of the family are fossil pollen and wood from the Upper Cretaceous of the Antarctica and Argentina, whereas in Australia the family first occurs in upper Palaeocene deposits. This discovery demonstrates that the family survived the Cretaceous-Palaeogene boundary event in Patagonia and that diversification of extant lineages in the family was under way by the earliest Cenozoic.","[Jud, Nathan A.; Gandolfo, Maria A.] Cornell Univ, Sch Integrat Plant Sci, Plant Biol Sect, LH Bailey Hortorium, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Iglesias, Ari] Univ Nacl Comahue, CONICET, Inst Invest Biodiversidad & Ambiente INIBIOMA, RA-8400 San Carlos De Bariloche, Rio Negro, Argentina; [Wilf, Peter] Penn State Univ, Dept Geosci, University Pk, PA 16802 USA","Jud, NA (corresponding author), Cornell Univ, Sch Integrat Plant Sci, Plant Biol Sect, LH Bailey Hortorium, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA.",nathan.jud@cornell.edu,"Jud, Nathan/AAI-2384-2020","Iglesias, Ari/0000-0002-9098-8758; Wilf, Peter/0000-0001-6813-1937","National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1556136, DEB-0918932, DEB-1556666, DEB-0919071, DEB-0345750]; Fulbright Foundation; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1556136] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","This work was supported by the National Science Foundation (grant numbers DEB-1556136, DEB-0918932, DEB-1556666, DEB-0919071, DEB-0345750) and the Fulbright Foundation (M.A.G.).",,99,11,12,0,6,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0305-7364,1095-8290,,ANN BOT-LONDON,Ann.

Despite great interest, a well resolved and complete phylogeny of the group and a reliable chronogram have been elusive due to their broad geographic distribution, paucity of samples, and challenging molecular composition. Here we present a molecular phylogenetic analysis of Onychophora that includes previously unsampled and undersampled lineages and we analyse the expanded dataset using a series of nested taxon sets designed to increase the amount of information available for particular subclades. These include a dataset with outgroups, one restricted to the ingroup taxa, and three others for Peripatopsidae, Peripatidae and Neopatida (= the Neotropical Peripatidae). To explore competing biogeographic scenarios we generate a new time tree for Onychophora using the few available reliable fossils as calibration points. Comparing our results to those of Cyphophthalmi, we reconsider the hypothesis that velvet worms reached Southeast Asia via Eurogondwana, and conclude that a more likely scenario is that they reached Southeast Asia by rafting on the Sibumasu terrane. Our phylogenetic results support the reciprocal monophyly of both families as well as an early division between East and West Gondwana, also in both families, each beginning to diversify between the Permian and the Jurassic. Peripatopsidae clearly supports paraphyly of South Africa with respect to southern South America (Chile) and a sister group relationship of the Southeast Asian/New Guinean Paraperipatus to the Australian/New Zealand taxa. The latter includes a clade that divides between Western Australia and Eastern Australia and two sister clades of trans-Tasman species (one oviparous and one viviparous). This pattern clearly shows that oviparity is secondarily derived in velvet worms. Peripatidae finds a sister group relationship between the Southeast Asian Eoperipatus and the West Gondwanan clade, which divides into the African Mesoperipatus and Neopatida. The latter shows a well supported split between the Pacific Oroperipatus (although it is unclear whether they form one or two clades) and a sister clade that includes the members of the genera Peripatus, Epiperipatus, Macroperipatus and representatives of the monotypic genera Cerradopatus, Plicatoperipatus and Principapillatus. However, Peripatus, Epiperipatus and Macroperipatus are not monophyletic, and all the species from the monotypic genera are related to geographically close species. The same goes for the type species of Macroperipatus (from Trinidad, and sister group to other Trinidad and Tobago species of Epiperipatus) and Epiperipatus (from French Guiana, and related to other Guyana shield species of Epiperipatus and Peripatus). Geographic structure within Neopatida is largely obscured by an unresolved backbone, but many well supported instances of generic non-monophyly challenge the current taxonomic framework, which has often relied on anatomical characters that are untested phylogenetically.","[Giribet, Gonzalo; Buckman-Young, Rebecca S.; Costa, Cristiano Sampaio; Baker, Caitlin M.; Benavides, Ligia R.] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Museum Comparat Zool, 26 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Buckman-Young, Rebecca S.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Integrat Biol, 250 N Mills St, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Costa, Cristiano Sampaio; Pinto-da-Rocha, Ricardo] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Biociencias, Dept Zool, Rua Matao Travessa 14,321 Cidade Univ, BR-05508090 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Branstetter, Michael G.] Utah State Univ, USDA ARS, Pollinating Insects Res Unit, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Daniels, Savel R.] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Bot & Zool, Private Bag X1, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa","Giribet, G (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Museum Comparat Zool, 26 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",ggiribet@g.harvard.edu,"Pinto-da-Rocha, Ricardo/J-6774-2012; Buckman-Young, Rebecca/C-4271-2019; Costa, Cristiano Sampaio/X-6310-2018; Giribet, Gonzalo/P-1086-2015","Pinto-da-Rocha, Ricardo/0000-0002-3959-2205; Costa, Cristiano Sampaio/0000-0002-0047-9328; Giribet, Gonzalo/0000-0002-5467-8429","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1457539, DEB-1144417, DOB-1343578]; National Geographic Society: Re-discovering the mite harvestmen (Arachnida, Opiliones, Cyphophthalmi, Neogoveidae) of the Brazilian Amazonas [9043-11]; MCZ; Putnam Expedition Grants Program from the MCZ; NSF GRFP FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD); FAPESPFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2011/20211-0, 2012/02969-6, 2014/20557-2]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF)","Many colleagues have assisted with field work and permits, including Miquel Arnedo, Jimmy Cabra, Pio Colmenares, Julia Cosgrove, Rosa Fernandez, Mark Harvey, Gustavo Hormiga, Ana Tourinho, Willians Porto.

This assemblage of closely related trypanosomes was determined by comparing whole SSU rDNA sequences of anuran trypanosomes from the Brazilian biomes of Amazonia, the Pantanal, and the Atlantic Forest and from Europe, North America, and Africa, and from trypanosomes of sand flies from Amazonia. Phylogenetic trees based on maximum likelihood and parsimony corroborated the positioning of all new anuran trypanosomes in the aquatic clade but did not support the monophyly of anuran trypanosomes. However, all analyses always supported four major clades (An01-04) of anuran trypanosomes. Clade An04 is composed of trypanosomes from exotic anurans. Isolates in clades An01 and An02 were from Brazilian frogs and toads captured in the three biomes studied, Amazonia, the Pantanal and the Atlantic Forest. Clade An01 contains mostly isolates from Hylidae whereas clade An02 comprises mostly isolates from Bufonidae; and clade An03 contains trypanosomes from sand flies and anurans of Bufonidae, Leptodactylidae, and Leiuperidae exclusively from Amazonia.

Johnsonomyia Felt, 1908 stat. rev. is restored from synonymy with Haplusia Karsch, 1877 (with Chastomera Skuse, 1888 confirmed as a junior synonym) and both genera are re-defined. Haplusia funebris Plakidas, 2007 and Wyattella lobata Yukawa, 1968 are newly combined in Johnsonomyia. Gynapteromyia Mamaev, 1965 is shown to be a species-rich, almost cosmopolitan genus, which absorbs several of the species previously classified in Haplusia or Chastomera. Gynapteromyia brevipalpis (Mamaev, 1964) comb. nov., G. heteroptera (Mamaev & Spungis, 1980) comb. nov., G. hondrui (Mamaev, 1964) comb. nov., G. indica (Grover, 1971) comb. nov., G. longipalpis (Mamaev, 1964) comb. nov., and G. stricta (Fedotova & Sidorenko, 2005) comb. nov. are all new combinations. dagger Palaeocolpodia eocenica Meunier, 1904 is considered to be a nomen dubium. Prior to the present study, the tribe Diallactiini contained 28 extant species classified in 6 genera. Previously unworked specimens of Diallactiini gathered by the author in the past 15 years were examined and identified as belonging to 57 different species, all unnamed. From that material, the following new taxa are described: Bruneiplusia gen. nov. (from Brunei), B. kaspraki sp. nov., Gynapteromyia costaricensis sp. nov. (Costa Rica), G. furcata sp. nov. (Costa Rica), G. novaezealandiae sp. nov. (New Zealand), G. tasmanica sp. nov. (Australia), G. temburong sp. nov. (Brunei), G. tenuistylata sp. nov. (Brunei), Haplusia afrotropica sp. nov. (South Africa), Japoplusia gen. nov. (Japan), Jap. honshuensis sp. nov., Johnsonomyia scabra sp. nov. (Costa Rica), John. serrata sp. nov. (South Africa), Loboplusia gen. nov. (Costa Rica), L. zurqui sp. nov., Makrostyles gen. nov. (Costa Rica), Makr. terrifica sp. nov., Mikrostyles gen. nov. (Brunei), Mikr. angustilobata sp. nov., Mikr. latolobata sp. nov., Wahabia gen. nov. (Brunei), Wah. mantici sp. nov., and Wyattella japonica sp. nov. (Japan). A key to the genera of Diallactiini based on male characters is presented. Diallactiini are shown to be a remarkably diverse group in terms of adult morphology. The genitalia of some male Diallactiini represent the most strongly modified such structures known in Winnertziinae. Morphological novelties found in Diallactiini, but no other Cecidomyiidae, include the fringed leg setae of Loboplusia and the furcate palpal sensilla in some Gynapteromyia and Mikrostyles. Diallactiini occur in all zoogeographic regions, with the highest generic and specific diversity found in the tropics (although Afrotropical diallactiines are poorly researched). Local diversity is also highest in the tropics, with as many as 29 species (unnamed or named in this paper) of at least 6 genera found at a single site, Zurqui de Moravia, in the cloud forest of Costa Rica. The best-explored fauna of Winnertziinae, including Diallactiini, is certainly that of Europe, but diallactiine biodiversity there is low and most of the nine European species are rarely encountered in the field. Gynapteromyia brevipalpis is reported from Sweden for the first time.","[Jaschhof, Mathias] Stn Linne, Olands Skogsby 161, SE-38693 Farjestaden, Sweden","Jaschhof, M (corresponding author), Stn Linne, Olands Skogsby 161, SE-38693 Farjestaden, Sweden.",mjaschhof@yahoo.de,,,Svenska ArtDatabanken; Swedish Species Information Centre; Swedish Taxonomy Initiative [dha 2014-150 4.3]; U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1145890],"This study was performed as part of the Gall Midge Project, which is funded by Svenska ArtDatabanken, The Swedish Species Information Centre, within the framework of Svenska Artprojektet, The Swedish Taxonomy Initiative (dha 2014-150 4.3).

Archiinocellia Handlirsch, 1910, Archiinocellia oligoneura Handlirsch, 1910 from Horsefly River (British Columbia, Canada), and A. protomaculata (Engel, 2011), comb. nov., from the Green River Formation (Colorado, United States of America) are redescribed. Archiinocellia is assigned to Raphidiidae, sit. nov. The apparent absence of sclerotized gonocoxites 9 in the Archiinocellia protomaculata male is probably plesiomorphic at the family level. As some modern snakeflies do not require a cold interval to complete their development and Eocene Inocelliidae and Raphidiidae lived in regions of warm winters (especially A. protomaculata), adaptation to cold winters in many modern snakeflies is a post-Eocene phenomenon. Eocene Raphidiidae of Europe (Priabonian) differ greatly from those of North America (Ypresian and Priabonian). This pattern might reflect dispersal in either direction or ranges established prior to continental separation. Eocene Inocelliidae of Europe (Priabonian), however, are more similar to those of North America (Ypresian and Lutetian).","[Archibald, S.

The Global Burden of Disease 2015 Study (GBD 2015) provides a comprehensive assessment of all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 249 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1980 to 2015. These results informed an in-depth investigation of observed and expected mortality patterns based on sociodemographic measures. Methods We estimated all-cause mortality by age, sex, geography, and year using an improved analytical approach originally developed for GBD 2013 and GBD 2010. Improvements included refinements to the estimation of child and adult mortality and corresponding uncertainty, parameter selection for under-5 mortality synthesis by spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression, and sibling history data processing. We also expanded the database of vital registration, survey, and census data to 14 294 geography-year datapoints. For GBD 2015, eight causes, including Ebola virus disease, were added to the previous GBD cause list for mortality. We used six modelling approaches to assess cause-specific mortality, with the Cause of Death Ensemble Model (CODEm) generating estimates for most causes. We used a series of novel analyses to systematically quantify the drivers of trends in mortality across geographies. First, we assessed observed and expected levels and trends of cause-specific mortality as they relate to the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator derived from measures of income per capita, educational attainment, and fertility. Second, we examined factors affecting total mortality patterns through a series of counterfactual scenarios, testing the magnitude by which population growth, population age structures, and epidemiological changes contributed to shifts in mortality. Finally, we attributed changes in life expectancy to changes in cause of death. We documented each step of the GBD 2015 estimation processes, as well as data sources, in accordance with Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER). Findings Globally, life expectancy from birth increased from 61.7 years (95% uncertainty interval 61.4-61.9) in 1980 to 71.8 years (71.5-72.2) in 2015. Several countries in sub-Saharan Africa had very large gains in life expectancy from 2005 to 2015, rebounding from an era of exceedingly high loss of life due to HIV/AIDS. At the same time, many geographies saw life expectancy stagnate or decline, particularly for men and in countries with rising mortality from war or interpersonal violence. From 2005 to 2015, male life expectancy in Syria dropped by 11.3 years (3.7-17.4), to 62.6 years (56.5-70.2). Total deaths increased by 4.1% (2.6-5.6) from 2005 to 2015, rising to 55.8 million (54.9 million to 56.6 million) in 2015, but age-standardised death rates fell by 17.0% (15.8-18.1) during this time, underscoring changes in population growth and shifts in global age structures. The result was similar for non-communicable diseases (NCDs), with total deaths from these causes increasing by 14.1% (12.6-16.0) to 39.8 million (39.2 million to 40.5 million) in 2015, whereas age-standardised rates decreased by 13.1% (11.9-14.3). Globally, this mortality pattern emerged for several NCDs, including several types of cancer, ischaemic heart disease, cirrhosis, and Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. By contrast, both total deaths and age-standardised death rates due to communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional conditions significantly declined from 2005 to 2015, gains largely attributable to decreases in mortality rates due to HIV/AIDS (42.1%, 39.1-44.6), malaria (43.1%, 34.7-51.8), neonatal preterm birth complications (29.8%, 24.8-34.9), and maternal disorders (29.1%, 19.3-37.1). Progress was slower for several causes, such as lower respiratory infections and nutritional deficiencies, whereas deaths increased for others, including dengue and drug use disorders. Age-standardised death rates due to injuries significantly declined from 2005 to 2015, yet interpersonal violence and war claimed increasingly more lives in some regions, particularly in the Middle East. In 2015, rotaviral enteritis (rotavirus) was the leading cause of under-5 deaths due to diarrhoea (146 000 deaths, 118 000-183 000) and pneumococcal pneumonia was the leading cause of under-5 deaths due to lower respiratory infections (393 000 deaths, 228 000-532 000), although pathogen-specific mortality varied by region. Globally, the effects of population growth, ageing, and changes in age-standardised death rates substantially differed by cause. Our analyses on the expected associations between cause-specific mortality and SDI show the regular shifts in cause of death composition and population age structure with rising SDI. Country patterns of premature mortality (measured as years of life lost [YLLs]) and how they differ from the level expected on the basis of SDI alone revealed distinct but highly heterogeneous patterns by region and country or territory. Ischaemic heart disease, stroke, and diabetes were among the leading causes of YLLs in most regions, but in many cases, intraregional results sharply diverged for ratios of observed and expected YLLs based on SDI. Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases caused the most YLLs throughout sub-Saharan Africa, with observed YLLs far exceeding expected YLLs for countries in which malaria or HIV/AIDS remained the leading causes of early death. Interpretation At the global scale, age-specific mortality has steadily improved over the past 35 years; this pattern of general progress continued in the past decade. Progress has been faster in most countries than expected on the basis of development measured by the SDI. Against this background of progress, some countries have seen falls in life expectancy, and age-standardised death rates for some causes are increasing. Despite progress in reducing age-standardised death rates, population growth and ageing mean that the number of deaths from most non-communicable causes are increasing in most countries, putting increased demands on health systems.

Understanding today's gains and gaps for the health-related SDGs is essential for decision makers as they aim to improve the health of populations. As part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016), we measured 37 of the 50 health-related SDG indicators over the period 1990-2016 for 188 countries, and then on the basis of these past trends, we projected indicators to 2030. Methods We used standardised GBD 2016 methods to measure 37 health-related indicators from 1990 to 2016, an increase of four indicators since GBD 2015. We substantially revised the universal health coverage (UHC) measure, which focuses on coverage of essential health services, to also represent personal health-care access and quality for several non-communicable diseases. We transformed each indicator on a scale of 0-100, with 0 as the 2.5th percentile estimated between 1990 and 2030, and 100 as the 97.5th percentile during that time. An index representing all 37 health-related SDG indicators was constructed by taking the geometric mean of scaled indicators by target. On the basis of past trends, we produced projections of indicator values, using a weighted average of the indicator and country-specific annualised rates of change from 1990 to 2016 with weights for each annual rate of change based on out-of-sample validity. 24 of the currently measured health-related SDG indicators have defined SDG targets, against which we assessed attainment. Findings Globally, the median health-related SDG index was 56.7 (IQR 31.9-66.8) in 2016 and country-level performance markedly varied, with Singapore (86.8, 95% uncertainty interval 84.6-88.9), Iceland (86.0, 84.1-87.6), and Sweden (85.6, 81.8-87.8) having the highest levels in 2016 and Afghanistan (10.9, 9.6-11.9), the Central African Republic (11.0, 8.8-13.8), and Somalia (11.3, 9.5-13.1) recording the lowest. Between 2000 and 2016, notable improvements in the UHC index were achieved by several countries, including Cambodia, Rwanda, Equatorial Guinea, Laos, Turkey, and China; however, a number of countries, such as Lesotho and the Central African Republic, but also high-income countries, such as the USA, showed minimal gains. Based on projections of past trends, the median number of SDG targets attained in 2030 was five (IQR 2-8) of the 24 defined targets currently measured. Globally, projected target attainment considerably varied by SDG indicator, ranging from more than 60% of countries projected to reach targets for under-5 mortality, neonatal mortality, maternal mortality ratio, and malaria, to less than 5% of countries projected to achieve targets linked to 11 indicator targets, including those for childhood overweight, tuberculosis, and road injury mortality. For several of the health-related SDGs, meeting defined targets hinges upon substantially faster progress than what most countries have achieved in the past. Interpretation GBD 2016 provides an updated and expanded evidence base on where the world currently stands in terms of the health-related SDGs. Our improved measure of UHC offers a basis to monitor the expansion of health services necessary to meet the SDGs. Based on past rates of progress, many places are facing challenges in meeting defined health-related SDG targets, particularly among countries that are the worst off. In view of the early stages of SDG implementation, however, opportunity remains to take actions to accelerate progress, as shown by the catalytic effects of adopting the Millennium Development Goals after 2000. With the SDGs' broader, bolder development agenda, multisectoral commitments and investments are vital to make the health-related SDGs within reach of all populations. Copyright The Authors.

For the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 (GBD 2015), we estimated the incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability for diseases and injuries at the global, regional, and national scale over the period of 1990 to 2015. Methods We estimated incidence and prevalence by age, sex, cause, year, and geography with a wide range of updated and standardised analytical procedures. Improvements from GBD 2013 included the addition of new data sources, updates to literature reviews for 85 causes, and the identification and inclusion of additional studies published up to November, 2015, to expand the database used for estimation of non-fatal outcomes to 60 900 unique data sources. Prevalence and incidence by cause and sequelae were determined with DisMod-MR 2.1, an improved version of the DisMod-MR Bayesian meta-regression tool first developed for GBD 2010 and GBD 2013. For some causes, we used alternative modelling strategies where the complexity of the disease was not suited to DisMod-MR 2.1 or where incidence and prevalence needed to be determined from other data. For GBD 2015 we created a summary indicator that combines measures of income per capita, educational attainment, and fertility (the Socio-demographic Index [SDI]) and used it to compare observed patterns of health loss to the expected pattern for countries or locations with similar SDI scores. Findings We generated 9.3 billion estimates from the various combinations of prevalence, incidence, and YLDs for causes, sequelae, and impairments by age, sex, geography, and year. In 2015, two causes had acute incidences in excess of 1 billion: upper respiratory infections (17.2 billion, 95% uncertainty interval [UI] 15.4-19.2 billion) and diarrhoeal diseases (2.39 billion, 2.30-2.50 billion). Eight causes of chronic disease and injury each affected more than 10% of the world's population in 2015: permanent caries, tension-type headache, iron-deficiency anaemia, age-related and other hearing loss, migraine, genital herpes, refraction and accommodation disorders, and ascariasis. The impairment that affected the greatest number of people in 2015 was anaemia, with 2.36 billion (2.35-2.37 billion) individuals affected. The second and third leading impairments by number of individuals affected were hearing loss and vision loss, respectively. Between 2005 and 2015, there was little change in the leading causes of years lived with disability (YLDs) on a global basis. NCDs accounted for 18 of the leading 20 causes of age-standardised YLDs on a global scale. Where rates were decreasing, the rate of decrease for YLDs was slower than that of years of life lost (YLLs) for nearly every cause included in our analysis. For low SDI geographies, Group 1 causes typically accounted for 20-30% of total disability, largely attributable to nutritional deficiencies, malaria, neglected tropical diseases, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis. Lower back and neck pain was the leading global cause of disability in 2015 in most countries. The leading cause was sense organ disorders in 22 countries in Asia and Africa and one in central Latin America; diabetes in four countries in Oceania; HIV/AIDS in three southern sub-Saharan African countries; collective violence and legal intervention in two north African and Middle Eastern countries; iron-deficiency anaemia in Somalia and Venezuela; depression in Uganda; onchoceriasis in Liberia; and other neglected tropical diseases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Interpretation Ageing of the world's population is increasing the number of people living with sequelae of diseases and injuries. Shifts in the epidemiological profile driven by socioeconomic change also contribute to the continued increase in years lived with disability (YLDs) as well as the rate of increase in YLDs. Despite limitations imposed by gaps in data availability and the variable quality of the data available, the standardised and comprehensive approach of the GBD study provides opportunities to examine broad trends, compare those trends between countries or subnational geographies, benchmark against locations at similar stages of development, and gauge the strength or weakness of the estimates available.

The SDGs specify 17 universal goals, 169 targets, and 230 indicators leading up to 2030. We provide an analysis of 33 health-related SDG indicators based on the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2015 (GBD 2015). Methods We applied statistical methods to systematically compiled data to estimate the performance of 33 health-related SDG indicators for 188 countries from 1990 to 2015. We rescaled each indicator on a scale from 0 (worst observed value between 1990 and 2015) to 100 (best observed). Indices representing all 33 health-related SDG indicators (health-related SDG index), health-related SDG indicators included in the Millennium Development Goals (MDG index), and health-related indicators not included in the MDGs (non-MDG index) were computed as the geometric mean of the rescaled indicators by SDG target. We used spline regressions to examine the relations between the Socio-demographic Index (SDI, a summary measure based on average income per person, educational attainment, and total fertility rate) and each of the health-related SDG indicators and indices. Findings In 2015, the median health-related SDG index was 59.3 (95% uncertainty interval 56.8-61.8) and varied widely by country, ranging from 85.5 (84.2-86.5) in Iceland to 20.4 (15.4-24.9) in Central African Republic. SDI was a good predictor of the health-related SDG index (r(2) = 0.88) and the MDG index (r(2) = 0.92), whereas the non-MDG index had a weaker relation with SDI (r(2) = 0.79). Between 2000 and 2015, the health-related SDG index improved by a median of 7.9 (IQR 5.0-10.4), and gains on the MDG index (a median change of 10.0 [6.7-13.1]) exceeded that of the nonMDG index (a median change of 5.5 [2.1-8.9]). Since 2000, pronounced progress occurred for indicators such as met need with modern contraception, under-5 mortality, and neonatal mortality, as well as the indicator for universal health coverage tracer interventions. Moderate improvements were found for indicators such as HIV and tuberculosis incidence, minimal changes for hepatitis B incidence took place, and childhood overweight considerably worsened. Interpretation GBD provides an independent, comparable avenue for monitoring progress towards the health-related SDGs. Our analysis not only highlights the importance of income, education, and fertility as drivers of health improvement but also emphasises that investments in these areas alone will not be sufficient. Although considerable progress on the health-related MDG indicators has been made, these gains will need to be sustained and, in many cases, accelerated to achieve the ambitious SDG targets. The minimal improvement in or worsening of health-related indicators beyond the MDGs highlight the need for additional resources to effectively address the expanded scope of the health-related SDGs.","[Lim, Stephen S.; Allen, Kate; Dandona, Lalit; Forouzanfar, Mohammad H.; Fullman, Nancy; Goldberg, Ellen M.; Hay, Simon I.; Holmberg, Mollie; Kutz, Michael J.; Larson, Heidi J.; Lopez, Alan D.; McNellan, Claire R.; Mokdad, Ali H.; Mooney, Meghan D.; Naghavi, Mohsen; Olsen, Helen E.; Pigott, David M.; Vos, Theo; Wang, Haidong; Achoki, Tom; Afshin, Ashkan; Allen, Christine; Anderson, Gregory M.; Barber, Ryan; Bienhoff, Kelly A.; Blore, Jed; Brauer, Michael; Carter, Austin; Casey, Daniel; Charlson, Fiona J.; Chen, Alan Zian; Coates, Matthew M.; Coggeshall, Megan; Cohen, Aaron J.; Deshpande, Aniruddha; Erskine, Holly E.; Ferrari, Alize J.; Fitzmaurice, Christina; Foreman, Kyle; Fraser, Maya; Friedman, Joseph; Frostad, Joseph; Godwin, William; Graetz, Nicholas; Griswold, Max; Haagsma, Juanita A.; Haakenstad, Annie; Kassebaum, Nicholas J.; Kemmer, Laura; Kulikoff, Xie Rachel; Kyu, Hmwe H.; Leung, Janni; Lind, Margaret; Liu, Patrick Y.; Masiye, Felix; Mirarefi, Mojde; Misganaw, Awoke; Moradi-Lakeh, Maziar; Nguyen, Grant; Pinho, Christine; Rao, Puja C.; Reitsma, Marissa B.; Roth, Gregory A.; Santomauro, Damian F.; Shackelford, Katya; Silpakit, Naris; Sligar, Amber; Sorensen, Reed J.

The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) provides a comprehensive assessment of prevalence, incidence, and years lived with disability (YLDs) for 328 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2016. Methods We estimated prevalence and incidence for 328 diseases and injuries and 2982 sequelae, their non-fatal consequences. We used DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, as the main method of estimation, ensuring consistency between incidence, prevalence, remission, and cause of death rates for each condition. For some causes, we used alternative modelling strategies if incidence or prevalence needed to be derived from other data. YLDs were estimated as the product of prevalence and a disability weight for all mutually exclusive sequelae, corrected for comorbidity and aggregated to cause level. We updated the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator of income per capita, years of schooling, and total fertility rate. GBD 2016 complies with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER). Findings Globally, low back pain, migraine, age-related and other hearing loss, iron-deficiency anaemia, and major depressive disorder were the five leading causes of YLDs in 2016, contributing 57.6 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 40.8-75.9 million [7.2%, 6.0-8.3]), 45.1 million (29.0-62.8 million [5.6%, 4.0-7.2]), 36.3 million (25.3-50.9 million [4.5%, 3.8-5.3]), 34.7 million (23.0-49.6 million [4.3%, 3.5-5.2]), and 34.1 million (23.5-46.0 million [4.2%, 3.2-5.3]) of total YLDs, respectively. Age-standardised rates of YLDs for all causes combined decreased between 1990 and 2016 by 2.7% (95% UI 2.3-3.1). Despite mostly stagnant age-standardised rates, the absolute number of YLDs from non-communicable diseases has been growing rapidly across all SDI quintiles, partly because of population growth, but also the ageing of populations. The largest absolute increases in total numbers of YLDs globally were between the ages of 40 and 69 years. Age-standardised YLD rates for all conditions combined were 10.4% (95% UI 9.0-11.8) higher in women than in men. Iron-deficiency anaemia, migraine, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, major depressive disorder, anxiety, and all musculoskeletal disorders apart from gout were the main conditions contributing to higher YLD rates in women. Men had higher age-standardised rates of substance use disorders, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and all injuries apart from sexual violence. Globally, we noted much less geographical variation in disability than has been documented for premature mortality. In 2016, there was a less than two times difference in age-standardised YLD rates for all causes between the location with the lowest rate (China, 9201 YLDs per 100 000, 95% UI 6862-11943) and highest rate (Yemen, 14 774 YLDs per 100 000, 11 018-19 228). Interpretation The decrease in death rates since 1990 for most causes has not been matched by a similar decline in age-standardised YLD rates. For many large causes, YLD rates have either been stagnant or have increased for some causes, such as diabetes. As populations are ageing, and the prevalence of disabling disease generally increases steeply with age, health systems will face increasing demand for services that are generally costlier than the interventions that have led to declines in mortality in childhood or for the major causes of mortality in adults. Up-todate information about the trends of disease and how this varies between countries is essential to plan for an adequate health-system response. Copyright (C) The Author(s).

Understanding how all-cause mortality has changed with respect to development status can identify exemplars for best practice. To accomplish this, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) estimated age-specific and sex-specific all-cause mortality between 1970 and 2016 for 195 countries and territories and at the subnational level for the five countries with a population greater than 200 million in 2016. Methods We have evaluated how well civil registration systems captured deaths using a set of demographic methods called death distribution methods for adults and from consideration of survey and census data for children younger than 5 years. We generated an overall assessment of completeness of registration of deaths by dividing registered deaths in each location-year by our estimate of all-age deaths generated from our overall estimation process. For 163 locations, including subnational units in countries with a population greater than 200 million with complete vital registration (VR) systems, our estimates were largely driven by the observed data, with corrections for small fluctuations in numbers and estimation for recent years where there were lags in data reporting (lags were variable by location, generally between 1 year and 6 years). For other locations, we took advantage of different data sources available to measure under-5 mortality rates (U5MR) using complete birth histories, summary birth histories, and incomplete VR with adjustments; we measured adult mortality rate (the probability of death in individuals aged 15-60 years) using adjusted incomplete VR, sibling histories, and household death recall. We used the U5MR and adult mortality rate, together with crude death rate due to HIV in the GBD model life table system, to estimate age-specific and sex-specific death rates for each location-year. Using various international databases, we identified fatal discontinuities, which we defined as increases in the death rate of more than one death per million, resulting from conflict and terrorism, natural disasters, major transport or technological accidents, and a subset of epidemic infectious diseases; these were added to estimates in the relevant years. In 47 countries with an identified peak adult prevalence for HIV/AIDS of more than 0.5% and where VR systems were less than 65% complete, we informed our estimates of age-sex-specific mortality using the Estimation and Projection Package (EPP)-Spectrum model fitted to national HIV/AIDS prevalence surveys and antenatal clinic serosurveillance systems. We estimated stillbirths, early neonatal, late neonatal, and childhood mortality using both survey and VR data in spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression models. We estimated abridged life tables for all location-years using age-specific death rates. We grouped locations into development quintiles based on the Sociodemographic Index (SDI) and analysed mortality trends by quintile. Using spline regression, we estimated the expected mortality rate for each age-sex group as a function of SDI. We identified countries with higher life expectancy than expected by comparing observed life expectancy to anticipated life expectancy on the basis of development status alone. Findings Completeness in the registration of deaths increased from 28% in 1970 to a peak of 45% in 2013; completeness was lower after 2013 because of lags in reporting. Total deaths in children younger than 5 years decreased from 1970 to 2016, and slower decreases occurred at ages 5-24 years. By contrast, numbers of adult deaths increased in each 5-year age bracket above the age of 25 years. The distribution of annualised rates of change in age-specific mortality rate differed over the period 2000 to 2016 compared with earlier decades: increasing annualised rates of change were less frequent, although rising annualised rates of change still occurred in some locations, particularly for adolescent and younger adult age groups. Rates of stillbirths and under-5 mortality both decreased globally from 1970. Evidence for global convergence of death rates was mixed; although the absolute difference between age-standardised death rates narrowed between countries at the lowest and highest levels of SDI, the ratio of these death rates-a measure of relative inequality-increased slightly. There was a strong shift between 1970 and 2016 toward higher life expectancy, most noticeably at higher levels of SDI. Among countries with populations greater than 1 million in 2016, life expectancy at birth was highest for women in Japan, at 86.9 years (95% UI 86.7-87.2), and for men in Singapore, at 81.3 years (78.8-83.7) in 2016. Male life expectancy was generally lower than female life expectancy between 1970 and 2016, and the gap between male and female life expectancy increased with progression to higher levels of SDI. Some countries with exceptional health performance in 1990 in terms of the difference in observed to expected life expectancy at birth had slower progress on the same measure in 2016. Interpretation Globally, mortality rates have decreased across all age groups over the past five decades, with the largest improvements occurring among children younger than 5 years. However, at the national level, considerable heterogeneity remains in terms of both level and rate of changes in age-specific mortality; increases in mortality for certain age groups occurred in some locations. We found evidence that the absolute gap between countries in age-specific death rates has declined, although the relative gap for some age-sex groups increased. Countries that now lead in terms of having higher observed life expectancy than that expected on the basis of development alone, or locations that have either increased this advantage or rapidly decreased the deficit from expected levels, could provide insight into the means to accelerate progress in nations where progress has stalled.
