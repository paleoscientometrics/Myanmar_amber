Three ants from this amber were found out in the collection of the Natural History of Museum in London. Burmomyrma rossi sp. nov. (fig. 3) differs from other known ants by the combination of reduced wing venation (absence of closed cells), the presence of sting, one segmented waist and absence of constriction between 1 and 2 gastral segments. The holotype of B. rossi has no head, so it is impossible to determine precisely taxonomic position of new genus. Haidomyrmex cerberus sp. nov. (fig. 1) is the extraordinary specialised Sphecomyrminae ant with L-shaped mandibles and unusual structure of cranio-mandibular system. All known ants with trap-like mandibles have increased back part of the head, while H. cerberus have extended genae. The fragments of other ant (gaster, legs and deformed petiolus and propodeum) are present in the same piece of amber (fig. 26). The poor preservation state of specimen does not permit to make species description. The presence of sting and absence of constriction between 1 and 2 gastral segments in this ant and in B. rossi definitely indicates that they belongs to subfamilies Aneuretinae, Nothomyrmeciinae, or Sphecomyrminae.","[Dlussky, GM] Moscow State University, Moscow, Russia","Dlussky, GM (corresponding author), MOSCOW MV LOMONOSOV STATE UNIV, MOSCOW, RUSSIA.",,,,,,,15,3,4,0,0,MAIK NAUKA/INTERPERIODICA/SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013-1578 USA",0031-031X,,,PALEONTOL ZH,Paleontologicheskii Zhurnal,JUL-SEP,1996,,3,,,,,83,89,,,,,7,Paleontology,Paleontology,VU089,WOS:A1996VU08900012,,,,,20/07/2021

Hennig's scheme deriving the venation of Horaiella from that of Eophlebotomus could equally well have used a trichomyiine or a sycoracine as the starting point and therefore does not specifically support the hypothesis that Horaiella is the sister group. The phlebotomine-like features of Eophlebotomus are plesiomorphies mostly also occurring in Sycoracinae, but there are also several synapomorphies supporting a particular relationship between Eophlebotomus and Sycoracinae or Trichomyiinae or both.

So far, 38 fossil species belonging to six families have been described or recorded, most of Cenozoic age. Knowledge about the evolutionary history of the major groups of Gerromorpha is seriously hampered by the scarcity of well-preserved Mesozoic fossils, especially from the Cretaceous. The present paper reports on a well-preserved semiaquatic bug from amber collected in the northern part of Myanmar (Burma). The source of this fossiliferous amber was previously considered to be Eocene in age, but recent evidence indicates that it originated in the Middle Cretaceous (Turonian-Cenomanian), or 100-90 Ma. The fossil species is described as Carinametra burmensis gen. et sp. n. The presence of three pairs of cephalic trichobothria, a prolonged head, long slender antennae and legs, reduced wing venation, etc., places the fossil in the gerromorphan family Hydrometridae, or water measurers. Other characters suggest a close relationship with the two extant genera of the most basal of the hydrometrid subfamilies, Heterocleptinae. We present and discuss the available evidence used in the dating of Burmese amber. Finally, we discuss the phylogenetic, paleobiological, and biogeographic significance of the new fossil.","[Andersen, NM] Univ Copenhagen, Zool Museum, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Grimaldi, D] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, New York, NY 10024 USA","Andersen, NM (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Zool Museum, Univ Pk 15, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.",nmandersen@zmuc.ku.dk; grimaldi@amnh.org,,,,,,36,18,21,0,5,BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",1399-560X,1876-312X,,INSECT SYST EVOL,Insect Syst.

Age of the material was ambiguous, but probably Cretaceous. Numerous new records and taxa occur in this amber, based on newly excavated material in the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) containing 3100 organisms. Without having all groups studied, significant new records and taxa thus far include the following (a 1 refers to extinct taxa): For Plants: An angiosperm flower (only the third in Cretaceous amber), spores and apparent sporangia of an unusual but common fungus, hepatophyte thalli and an archegoniophore of Marchantiaceae, and leafy shoots of Metasequoia (Coniferae). Metasequoia is possibly the source of the amber. For Animals: Mermithidae and other Nematoda; the oldest ixodid tick (a larval Amblyomma); bird feathers; and the only Mesozoic record of the Onychophora (velvet worms), described as *Cretoperipatus burmiticus, n. gen., n. sp. (Peripatidae). Poinar's classification of the Onychophora is substantially revised. Still largely unstudied, the fauna of mites (Acari) and spiders (Araneae) appears to be the most diverse ones known for the Mesozoic. For Insecta: Odonata indet. (wing fragment); Plecoptera indet.; new genera of Dermaptera, Embiidina, and Zoraptera (the latter two as the only definitive Mesozoic fossils of their orders). Within Hemiptera, there are primitive new genera in the Aradidae, Hydrometridae, Piesmatidae, Schizopteridae, and Cimicomorpha (Heteroptera), as well as in *Tajmyraphididae (Aphidoidea), and *Protopsyllidiidae. An adult snakefly (Raphidioptera: *Mesoraphidiidae) is the smallest species in the order, and new genera occur in the Neuroptera: Coniopterygidae, Berothidae, and Psychopsidae, as well as larvae of apparent Nevrorthidae. Coleoptera are largely unstudied, but are probably the most diverse assemblage known from the Cretaceous, particularly for Staphylinidae. An adult lymexylid, the most primitive species of Atractocerus, is the first Mesozoic record of the family. In Hymenoptera there are primitive ants (Formicidae: Ponerinae n. gen., and *Sphecomyrma n.sp [Sphecomyrminae]), the oldest record of the Pompilidae, and significant new records of *Serphitidae and *Stigmaphronidae, among others. Diptera are the most diverse and abundant, with the oldest definitive Blephariceridae and mosquito (Culicidae), as well as new genera in the Acroceridae, Bibionidae, Empidoidea; a new genus near the enigmatic genus Valeseguya, and an unusual new genus in the *Archizelmiridae. *Chimeromyia (Diptera: Eremoneura), known previously in ambers from the Lower Cretaceous, is also represented. The stratigraphic distribution of exclusively Mesozoic arthropods in Burmese amber is reviewed, which indicates a probable Turonian-Cenomanian age of this material (90-100 Ma). Paleofaunal differences between the NHML and AMNH collections are discussed, as is the distinct tropical nature of the original biota. Burmese amber probably harbors the most diverse biota in amber from the Cretaceous, and one of the most diverse Mesozoic microbiotas now known.","[Grimaldi, DA] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrates, New York, NY 10024 USA; Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Engel, MS] Univ Kansas, Div Entomol, Museum Nat Hist, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Nascibene, PC] Univ Kansas, Biodiver Res Ctr, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA","Grimaldi, DA (corresponding author), Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrates, New York, NY 10024 USA.",grimaldi@amnh.org; nosh@amnh.org,"Engel, Michael S/C-5461-2012","Engel, Michael S/0000-0003-3067-077X",,,,178,565,635,2,83,AMER MUSEUM NATURAL HISTORY,NEW YORK,"ATTN: LIBRARY-SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATIONS DISTRIBUTION, CENTRAL PK WEST AT 79TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10024-5192 USA",0003-0082,1937-352X,,AM MUS NOVIT,Am.

A catalogue of Protopsyllidiidae is provided as well as an hypothesis of phylogenetic relationships among genera, though monophyly of the family is ambiguous. Postopsyllidium appears to be a recently derived genus, and four genera are removed from the family.

Five new Mantodea are described from Cretaceous deposits on four continents, including: concretions in limestone from the Santana Formation of northeast Brazil (Aptian, 120 Ma), inclusions in amber from the Raritan Formation of New Jersey, USA (Turonian, 90 Ma), and in amber from undetermined formations of Lebanon (Barremian, 125 Ma) and northern Myanmar (Burma) (approximately early Cenomanian to late Albian, 100 Ma). Prior to this, virtually all of the oldest mantises were from five Cretaceous localities in Eurasia. New Mantodea are Santanmantis axelrodi, n. gen., n. sp. (Brazil); Ambermantis wozniaki, n. gen., n. sp. (New Jersey); Jersimantis burmiticus, n. sp. (Myaninar); and Burmantis asiatica and B. lebanensis, n. gen. and n. spp. (Myanmar and Lebanon, respectively). The first two are based on adults, the last three on nymphs. Cladistic analysis of 26 morphological characters and 20 taxa, including living families and well-preserved fossils, indicates that Cretaceous mantises are phylogenetically basal to all living species and do not belong to the most basal living families Chaeteessidae, Mantoididae, and Metallyticidae. The classification of Cretaceous Mantodea is revised, which includes Santanmantidae, n. fam. and Ambermantidae, n. fam. Stratigraphic and cladistic ranks of taxa, with now improved fossil sampling, indicate that the order Mantodea is relatively recent like Isoptera (termites), with an origin no earlier than Late Jurassic. Superfamily Mantoidea, comprising three families and 95% of the Recent species in the order, radiated in the Early Tertiary to produce the exuberance of forms seen today.","[Grimaldi, D] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Grimaldi, D]CUNY, Dept Ecol & Evolut Biol, New York, NY 10021 USA; [Grimaldi, D]Cornell Univ, Dept Entomol, Ithaca, NY 14853 USA; [Grimaldi, D]Columbia Univ, Dept Ecol Evolutionary & Environm Biol, New York, NY 10027 USA","Grimaldi, D (corresponding author), Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, New York, NY 10024 USA.",grimaldi@amnh.org,,,,,,53,51,60,0,17,AMER MUSEUM NATURAL HISTORY,NEW YORK,"ATTN: LIBRARY-SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATIONS DISTRIBUTION, CENTRAL PK WEST AT 79TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10024-5192 USA",0003-0082,1937-352X,,AM MUS NOVIT,Am.

A cladogram is presented for the relationships among archizelmirid species, cladistic rank of which correlates with stratigraphic age.

Antennal and mouthpart structure suggest the female of this fossil species was a vertebrate blood feeder. The age of Burmese amber has been estimated as between Upper Albian to Turonian, 100-90 million years ago but the origins of the Culicidae are likely significantly older. The sister group of the Culicidae are the Chaoboridae, known as Jurassic fossils, and the Culicidae therefore must be equally as old.

The forelegs of the fossil contain a patella, the major character on which the new subfamily is based. The patella is regarded as an example of functional morphology and probably served in the capacity of catching and/or holding down prey, probably mites, since all extant members of this family are mite predators. This character appears to have been specific to this clade of antlike stone beetles, since no other members (extinct or extant) of the family have a patella. Another unusual character of H. burmitis is the extended abdomen and elongate strongly sclerotized ovipositor, thus allowing eggs to be inserted into cracks or soft tissue.

A triungulin from the Late Cretaceous (Campanian, c. 80 myo) of Manitoba, Canada is possibly a strepsipteran. The triungulin is described in detail but its morphology does not conform to any known clade of Recent strepsipterans. Other Cretaceous triungula reported here are in Burmese amber and are probably of the family Rhipiphoridae (Coleoptera), and bizarre (possibly coleopteran) triungula in mid-Cretaceous (Turonian, c. 90 myo) amber from New Jersey, USA. Phylogenetic analysis confirms the primitive position of Cretostylops among families of Strepsiptera, but it is not as primitive as Protoxenos in Eocene Baltic amber. Protoxenos and Cretostylops are still too highly modified to address the controversial relationships of Strepsiptera among insect orders, but the generalized structure of the mandible is inconsistent with the hypothesis that this order is the sister group to Diptera or closely related to Mecopterida. Phylogeny of living and Recent Strepsiptera suggests an origin of the order in the Early Cretaceous or Late Jurassic, which is also inconsistent with this order being a sister group to the much older Diptera.","Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, New York, NY 10024 USA; Univ Oxford, Dept Zool, Oxford OX1 3PS, England; CUNY, Baruch Coll, Dept Nat Sci, New York, NY USA","Grimaldi, D (corresponding author), Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, Cent Pk W 79th St, New York, NY 10024 USA.",grimaldi@amnh.org; jeyaraney.kathirithamby@zoology.oxford.ac.uk; valerie_schawaroch@baruch.cuny.edu,,,,,,58,51,54,0,6,BRILL ACADEMIC PUBLISHERS,LEIDEN,"PLANTIJNSTRAAT 2, P O BOX 9000, 2300 PA LEIDEN, NETHERLANDS",1399-560X,1876-312X,,INSECT SYST EVOL,Insect Syst.

They include a cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus and trypanosomatid infection in an adult biting midge (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae), and a nuclear polyhedrosis virus in an adult sand fly (Diptera: Phlebotomidae), both from Early Cretaceous Burmese amber, several types of fungal thalli on the cuticle of an adult mosquito (Culicidae: Diptera), as well as a fungal growth on the prothorax of a fungus gnat (Mycetophilidae: Diptera) in Dominican amber and large tumors in the body cavity of a caterpillar (Lepidoptera) in Mexican amber. These discoveries suggest that insect polyhedrosis viruses were present 100 million years ago and present the possibility that vertebrate arboviruses (especially those in the family Reoviridae) could have evolved from cytoplasmic polyhedrosis viruses infecting biting insects.

Recent Lutzomyia feed oil a wide variety of terrestrial vertebrates, including reptiles, birds, and mammals. Three rare pieces of the amber are reported, two described in detail, which preserved assemblages of Lutzomyia swarms with strands of mammalian hair, indicating that at least some of the fossil species were mammal feeders. Microstructure of the fossil hair offers little diagnostic evidence, but is very similar to that of insectivores in the Solenodontidae. Further preserved evidence indicates that the fossil midges swarmed about an arboreal nest or site of decayed wood that was worked by a mammal, but at very specific times during formation of the amber. Other very rare Dominican amber pieces containing a flea and an ixodid tick also contain mammalian hairs of similar microstructure, together with Lutzomyia sandflies, possibly reflecting the ectoparasite community of a Miocene mammal. This parasitic association has implications regarding the evolution of vectors of mammalian pathogens like Leishmania and the study further reveals the extent of palaeobiological inference that is possible with amber.","[Penalver, E; Grimaldi, D]Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, New York, NY 10024 USA","Penalver, E (corresponding author), Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, Cent Pk W & 79th St, New York, NY 10024 USA.",penalver@amnh.org; grimaldi@amnh.org,,"Penalver Molla, Enrique/0000-0001-8312-6087",,,,73,17,19,0,11,ROYAL SOC EDINBURGH,EDINBURGH,"22-26 GEORGE ST, EDINBURGH EH2 2PQ, MIDLOTHIAN, SCOTLAND",0263-5933,,,T ROY SOC EDIN-EARTH,Trans.

This investigation is the first cladistic analysis to use more than fourfold as many characters as any prior study, and a broader sampling of taxa. The analysis of 189 morphological characters of all stages of representatives of all extant strepsipteran families and characters of adult males of amber fossils results in the following branching pattern: (dagger Protoxenos + (dagger Cretostylops + (dagger Mengea + (Mengenillidae + (Corioxenidae + (Bohartillidae + (Halictophagidae + (Elenchidae + (dagger Protelencholax + (Myrmecolacidae + (Callipharixenidae + (Xenidae + Stylopidae)))))))))))). The basal placement of the Baltic amber fossil dagger Protoxenos and the Burmese amber fossil dagger Cretostylops is well founded. Even though dagger Cretostylops is older than dagger Protoxenos it is almost certainly not the most basal strepsipteran group but the sister group of a clade comprising the Baltic amber fossil dagger Mengea + Strepsiptera s. str. (excl. stemlineage). Monophyly of Mengenillidae, Stylopidia, Stylopiformia s.l., Corioxenidae, Xenidae, and Stylopidae is confirmed. Mengenillidia is paraphyletic (with respect to dagger Mengea (Mengeidae)), Elenchidae (with respect to dagger Protelencholax) and the genus Stichotrema (with respect to the Baltic amber fossils). Thus Protelencholacidae fam. n. is described, and S. weitschati and S. triangulum are transferred to Palaeomyrmecolax. A ground plan of adult male Strepsiptera is provided and evolutionary interpretations are presented based on the obtained cladograms.

What the species with long proboscides fed upon is ambiguous, but it was doubtfully blood.

This work deals with 109 specimens from the mid Cretaceous (Cenomanian or possibly slightly lower) of Myanmar, 37 of which have been identified to the generic level; 14 new species are described. Two species of the family Isotomidae are placed in previously described genera. One is placed in the Late Cretaceous genus Protoismoma (burma), and one in the extant genus Proisotoma (s.l.) pettersoni. The remaining specimens are placed in 11 newly erected genera or as Incertae sedis taxa in the broadly construed families Sminthuridae, Isotomidae, and Neanuridae. The new genera are Sminthuridae (s.l.): Grinnellia, Sminthuricinus, Mucrovirga, and Sminthurconus; Isotomidae: Villusisotoma (two species, V. brevis and V. longa), Burmisotoma, Propachyotoma, and Protodesoria; Neanuridae (s.l.)

Most of the extinct genera are very similar to modern genera. This similarity, along with the occurrence of an extant genus, suggests that a greater proportion of the Collembola of Myanmar (Burma) survived the end-Cretaceous than did taxa in Canada, even though the former are approximately 30 Ma older.

Classified in Myrmaromella is the extinct Tertiary species, M. duerrenfeldi (Schluter and Kohring) n. comb., and the extant species M. chaoi (Lin) n. comb., M. cyclopterus (Fidalgo and De Santis) n. comb. and M. mira Girault rev. comb. (all from Palaeomymar). Classified in Zealaromma are the newly designated type species of the genus, Z. insulare (Valentine) n. comb. (from Palaeomymar) and Z. valentinei n. sp. Description of the structural diversity of extant and extinct mymarommatids is based on the 20 described species plus 15 undescribed extant morphospecies and several fossils from Tertiary Baltic amber and Burmese, Canadian and New Jersey Cretaceous amber. Evidence for monophyly of the genera is presented and the following phylogenetic relationships are hypothesized: Galloromma + (Archaeromma + (Zealaromma + (Mymaromella + (Palaeomymar + Mymaromma)))). Absence of mesotibial and metatibial spurs are newly proposed synapomorphies for Mymarommatoidea. New information is given on the structure of Serphitidae (Serphitoidea) based on study of several Taimyr and Canadian Cretaceous fossils, and structural features that are shared among Serphitoidea, Mymarommatoidea, Chalcidoidea and Platygastroidea are discussed relative to establishing their relationships. Several features, including gastral laterotergites, a mesopectal region similar to a netrion, and a forewing venation that could be ancestral to that of Platygastroidea suggest Serphitoidea is closely related to Platygastroidea. No new evidence was found to support a Serphitoidea + Mymarommatoidea sister-group relationship. Independent parameres in the groundplan of the male genitalia of Mymarommatoidea and Serphitoidea is a likely symplesiomorphy that differentiates them from Chalcidoidea and Platygastroidea. Two different types of specialized claval sensilla could support monophyly of Mymarommatoidea + Chalcidoidea, but further study throughout parasitic Hymenoptera is necessary to substantiate character-state distribution and homology.","[Gibson, GAP; Read, J] Agr & Agri Food Canada, Ottawa, ON K1A 0C6, Canada; [Huber, JT] Nat Resources Canada, Canadian Forestry Serv, ECORC, Ottawa, ON K1A 0C6, Canada","Gibson, GAP (corresponding author), Agr & Agri Food Canada, KW Neatby Bldg,960 Carling Ave, Ottawa, ON K1A 0C6, Canada.",gibsong@agr.gc.ca,,,,,,94,40,49,0,10,PENSOFT PUBL,SOFIA,"GEO MILEV STR 13A, SOFIA, 1111, BULGARIA",1070-9428,,,J HYMENOPT RES,J.

Nanophemera is among the smallest known burrowing mayflies at slightly over four millimeters in length, and it differs from related genera by details of its cubital and anal venation systems in the forewings.

It appears to be the oldest unequivocal fossil gecko, predating fragmentary skeletal remains from the Upper Cretaceous and being 43-56 My older than Yanatarogecko from the Lower Eocene, previously the oldest known gecko preserved in amber. It also provides firm evidence that gekkotans and possibly gekkonids were in Asia at this time. The Myanmar specimen shows, that the distinctive foot proportions and sophisticated adhesive mechanism, involving pads on the toes with transverse lamellae probably bearing numerous hair-like setae found in many modern geckos, had already evolved around 100My ago. The specimen is very small, even compared with juveniles of the smallest living geckos. However, the high numbers of lamellae on its toe pads suggest it is from a juvenile of a species with relatively large adult body size.","[Arnold, E.

Detailed morphological study of a new well-preserved Cretaceous Burmese amber fossil revealed strong evidence consistent with its taxonomic placement in the euaesthetine genus Octavius. We thus describe Octavius electrospinosus sp. nov., the first Cretaceous record of the genus and of the tribe Euaesthetini. Previously, the oldest records of Octavius and Euaesthetini were from the Eocene (Baltic amber) and discovery of O. electrospinosus sp. nov. therefore nearly doubles the minimum lineage age of Octavius, increasing it by similar to 50 million years. We also briefly review the known Euaesthetine subgroup fossil record and tabulate summary data for all previously described fossils. All are placed in extant genera, and have visible diagnostic generic-level characters including some putative synapomorphies as judged by recent phylogenetic work. Including O. electrospinosus sp. nov., there are now four known Cretaceous species, all of which belong to either Octavius, Nordenskioldia, or Stenus. To explain the long-term morphological stasis in this group of rove beetles, we suggest that the continuous presence of mesic habitats may have buffered these lineages from strong selection for morphological change. Considering the fossils along with phylogenetic hypotheses we suggest the Euaesthetine subgroup originated in the Late Jurassic-Early Cretaceous and the Staphylinine group in the Early Jurassic.

The studied assemblage originated from the Late Albian (Early Cretaceous) deposit of Archingeay-Les Nouillers in southwestern France. Phase-contrast X-ray synchrotron imaging, a technique recently developed for analysing amber inclusions, is used here for the first time to reconstruct very detailed views of two cockroach specimens fossilised in a piece of opaque amber. The Blattulidae Vishniakova, 1982, here represented by Batola. nikolai n. gen., n. sp. and Globula lake n. gen., n. sp. were, analogically as in sedimentary record, dominant; Liberiblattinidae Vrsansky, 2002, represented by Leptolythica vincenti n. gen., n. sp.; and Mesoblattinidae Handlirsch, 1906, represented by Sivis odpo n. gen., n. sp. were subdominant; the new family Eadiidae n. fam., with Eadia aidae n. gen., n. sp. occurs only in the present and Myanmar ambers; and a new, here not described family is yet only indigenous to this locality. Caloblattinidae Vrsansky & Ansorge, 2000 are rare apparently due to their large size and thus low resin-burial potential, in spite of their fairly common occurrence in the Late Mesozoic assemblages of rock fossil. The present assemblage considerably differs from the standard conservative worldwide Early Cretaceous assemblages of imprint fossils. In spite of alternative taxonomic composition at generic level, however, and due to the particular burial conditions in amber, this association is of a comparable, rather low, specific diversity.","[Vrsansky, Peter] Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Geol, Dubravska C 9,POB 106, Bratislava 84005, Slovakia; [Vrsansky, Peter] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Paleontol, Moscow 117868, Russia","Vrsansky, P (corresponding author), Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Geol, Dubravska C 9,POB 106, Bratislava 84005, Slovakia.",geolvrsa@savba.sk,"Vrsansky, Peter/ABE-7173-2020",,Agence nationale de la Recherche (ANR)French National Research Agency (ANR) [BLAN07-1-184190],"I thank Vincent Perrichot and Didier Neraudeau for organizing the Study, and for preparation of preliminary documentation and specimens.

Fossilized galleries of scolytines have been reported in Late Mesozoic wood, but here we describe a well-preserved body fossil from the Cretaceous, c. 100 Ma, preserved in amber from northern Myanmar. Moreover, the specimen is remarkably similar to Recent species of the genus Microborus, revealing stasis unexpected within scolytines and thus highlighting the antiquity of the group. Stratigraphic dating and comparison of insect palaeofaunas included in other well-dated ambers from multiple sites support the age estimate of the Burmese amber. A minimum age for one clade of scolytines is thus established, indicating an early divergence of scolytines from other weevils in the Late Jurassic or Early Cretaceous and challenging the current perspective of weevil evolution.","[Cognato, Anthony I.] Michigan State Univ, Dept Entomol, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA; [Grimaldi, David] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, New York, NY 10024 USA","Cognato, AI (corresponding author), Michigan State Univ, Dept Entomol, 243 Nat Sci Bldg, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.",cognato@msu.edu,,,"NSF PEETNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-0328920, DEB-0542726]","We thank Roger Beaver (Chiangmai, Thailand), Jiri Hulcr (MSU), Bjarte Jordal (University of Bergen), Mikhail Mandelshtam (Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, St. Petersburg), Aaron Smith (MSU), Alexander Kirejtshuk (Russian Academy of Sciences), and Stephen L.

Erroneous statements concerning fossil date estimates in the original study are corrected. We emphasize that the fossil record of chelicerates is more complete than is sometimes assumed, and that paleontology plays a key role in dating cladogenesis by setting minimum divergence times, which can and do falsify molecular clock estimates where the inferred divergence is substantially younger than the known fossil record. The oldest representatives of each chelicerate order are documented here, together with similar data for the major mite lineages down to family level.

Recent estimated ages vary from Albian to Cenomanian, based on palynology, an arnmonoid, and Mesozoic insect taxa preserved within the amber. The burmite-bearing rock is sedimentary and consists mainly of rounded lithic clasts (0.03 similar to 0.15 mm in diameter), with minor fragments of quartz and feldspar. Among the lithic clasts are mostly volcanic rocks. Zircons separated from the amber matrix form two groups: Group-1 zircons are overgrown and have variable CL patterns, experienced slight geological disturbances after they formed, and their Ion microprobe Pb-206/U-238 ages fall into a very narrow range of similar to 102 Ma- similar to 108 Ma; Group-II zircons are typical magmatic ones with rhythmically flat zones, inferred to be derived from volcanic rock clasts, and yielded a concordia Pb-206/U-238 age of 98.79 +/- 0.62 Ma. The dating on Group-1 zircons is only for their interiors, thus hiding what age excursion might come from the overgrowth. Considering the nearshore marine environment and 1-m thickness of the burmite-bearing sediments, and the syn- and post-eruption deposition of volcanic clasts, the age of 98.79 +/- 0.62 Ma therefore can be used as a maximum limit for the burmite (either at or after), establishing an earliest Cenomanian age for the fossilized inclusions. The age also indicates that volcanic eruption occurred at 98.79 +/- 0.62 Ma in the vicinity of the Hukawng Valley. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

These inclusions show a suite of characters that were not visible in the type specimen of F. cretacea. The new gametophytes consistently display rectangular to ovate underleaves that have two long-ciliate apical teeth in addition to 0-2 blunt lateral teeth. A narrow stylus is present on at least some leaves. The lobules usually form water sacs that are 1.2-2.3 times longer than wide, and are arranged at some distance from the stem. The observed combination of character states is not present in extant crown group lineages of Frullania. A syninclusion in one of the amber pieces is interpreted as a detached gynoecium of a second Cretaceous Frullania species and is described as F. baerlocheri, sp. nov. The subgynoecial underleaves of the syninclusion are suborbicular in shape, and allow for a separation of this species from F. cretacea. The described amber inclusions are the oldest representatives of an extant genus of leafy liverworts known so far. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

These included two Cretaceous ambers (from Myanmar [Burma] and central New Jersey), two Tertiary ambers (from the Baltic and the Dominican Republic), and Holocene copal from Zanzibar. The five resins were chosen for their disparate ages and botanical origins (and thus chemical and physical properties), as well as their paleontological significance. In all cases, pronounced deterioration occurred under combined exposure to light and fluctuating humidity, based on surface crazing and a decrease in absorbance of light in the UV region (360-400 nm). While crazing did not visibly occur in cases of fluctuating humidity in dark conditions, or UV exposure alone, spectrophotometric evidence indicates that some deterioration did take place. Yellowing after exposure to elevated temperatures occurred in all samples tested, with the exception of Burmese amber. All four true ambers exhibited a decrease in UV absorbance after exposure to heat (while copal actually showed an increase). The samples from the five deposits represent three chemical subclasses of fossil resins, and each of the resins reacted differently to the various aging conditions, with New Jersey amber particularly unstable. Based on these results, amber collections should be stored in an environment with stable humidity, relatively low heat, and minimal exposure to light. Anoxic sealing and storage, and particularly embedding amber samples in a high-grade epoxy, may be beneficial, and further investigation is indicated.","[Bisulca, Christina] Univ Arizona, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Arizona State Museum, Tucson, AZ 85712 USA; [Nascimbene, Paul C.; Grimaldi, David A.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Elkin, Lisa] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Off Registrar & Nat Sci Collect Conservat, New York, NY 10024 USA","Bisulca, C (corresponding author), Univ Arizona, Dept Mat Sci & Engn, Arizona State Museum, Tucson, AZ 85712 USA.",,,,"Natural Science Collections Conservation Grant; Board of Trustees, AMNH","The authors wish to thank reviewers Enrique Penalver and Janet Waddington for their comprehensive input and commentary, by which the paper was significantly improved.

The morphology and occurrence in the fossil record suggests a probable early origin of the family in scale insect evolution. The present phylogenetic analysis based on 69 morphological characters of female ortheziids, using 39 exemplar Recent species provides the first analytical assessment of relationships among living genera of the family, as well as the relationships of eight fossil species, based on complete, well-preserved specimens in amber. Monophyly of the subfamilies Newsteadiinae, Ortheziinae and Ortheziolinae is supported, but Nipponortheziinae is found to be paraphyletic by inclusion of the Ortheziolinae. Thus, the subfamily Ortheziolinae is reduced in rank to tribe Ortheziolini stat.n., which now includes Matileortheziola Kozar & Foldi, Ortheziolacoccus Kozar, Ortheziolamameti Kozar and OrtheziolaSulc.

The amber is radiometrically dated at 99 myo. Zigrasimecia is closely related to another basal genus of ants known only in Burmese and French Cretaceous amber, Sphecomyrmodes Engel and Grimaldi, based in part on the shared possession of a comb of pegs on the clypeal margin, as well as mandible structure. Highly specialized features of Zigrasimecia include extensive development of the clypeal comb, a thick brush of setae on the oral surface of the mandibles and on the labrum, and a head that is broad, flattened, and which bears a crown of blackened, rugose cuticle. Mouthparts are hypothesized to have functioned in a unique manner, showing no clear signs of dentition representative of chewing or otherwise processing solid food. Although all ants in Burmese amber are basal, stem-group taxa, there is an unexpected diversity of mouthpart morphologies and probable feeding modes.","[Barden, Phillip] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, New York, NY 10024 USA; Amer Museum Nat Hist, Richard Gilder Grad Sch, New York, NY 10024 USA","Barden, P (corresponding author), Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, New York, NY 10024 USA.",pbarden@amnh.org; grimaldi@amnh.org,,"Barden, Phillip/0000-0001-6277-320X",National Science Foundation PredoctoralNational Science Foundation (NSF); Richard Gilder Graduate School fellowships; Direct For Biological SciencesNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [0850543] Funding Source: National Science Foundation,"We are grateful for the loan of the unique specimen by James Zigras, and for his continued generosity in loaning specimens from his collection; to Brian Fisher for insight into clypeal and labral setae structures; Steve Thurston, for assistance with figures; and two anonymous reviewers for valuable feedback.

Haidoterminus cippus new genus and species expands the distribution of the bizarre, exclusively Cretaceous, trap-jawed Haidomyrmecini beyond their previous records in mid-Cretaceous Burmese and French amber, and into Laurentia. The new material from the Grassy Lake, Alberta, Canada collecting locality also provides evidence that these highly specialised, likely arboreal, ants persisted for an additional 20 million years, reaching the Late Cretaceous. Morphological features of H. cippus, such as the presence of an elongate antennomere II (pedicel), further support the argument that Haidomyrmecini may not actually belong within the subfamily Sphecomyrminae, and may warrant recognition at the subfamily level or inclusion as a highly autapomorphic clade within another subfamily. Despite the introduction of new fossil material, and the clarity of preservation in Canadian amber, the mystery of how Haidomyrmecini fed remains unsolved.","[McKellar, Ryan C.; Engel, Michael S.] Univ Kansas, Museum Nat Hist, Div Entomol Paleoentomol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [McKellar, Ryan C.; Engel, Michael S.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [McKellar, Ryan C.] Univ Alberta, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Edmonton, AB T6G 2E3, Canada; [Glasier, James R.

However, Cretaceous moss fossils are generally rare. Here we describe a sterile gametophyte fragment of an acrocarpous moss preserved in mid-Cretaceous amber from Myanmar.

The protruding cells of the awns point to the possibility that they previously carried gemmae, as is seen in numerous extant representatives of the Calymperaceae genera Calymperes and Syrrhopodon.

All inclusions share the presence of long and relatively thin-walled cells in the middle portion of the leaf lamina, a relatively narrow costa with dorsal teeth, slightly differentiated marginal cells, and almost exclusively unicellular teeth in the leaf margin, indicating affinities to hypnodendralean pleurocarpous mosses. Re-investigation of the holotype of Vetiplanaxis pyrrhobryoides from the same amber deposit allows for a revision of the current taxonomic treatment as a putative member of Rhizogoniales, and tentatively supports the original interpretation as a member of Hypnodendrales. Three further fossils are described as new species Vetiplanaxis espinosus. Vetiplanaxis longiacuminatus, and Venplanaxis oblongus. These new finds indicate that a diverse pleurocarpous moss flora was present in the Cretaceous amber forest of Myanmar, and mark this deposit as one of the most promising localities for reconstructing Cretaceous bryophyte floras.

Two new genera and four new species are reported in these samples: Cretasonoma corinformibus in the supertribe Faronitae, and Penarhytus tenebris in the supertribe Pselaphitae, both in the subfamily Pselaphinae; Prosolierius parvus in the subfamily Solieriinae; and Kachinus magnificus in the subfamily Scydmaeninae. Both Prosolierius and Kachinus exemplify the similarity between Cretaceous Spanish amber and Cretaceous Lebanese and Burmese amber, despite their different ages. Pselaphinae is the most common rove beetle subfamily in amber inclusions worldwide, their small size and cryptic litter-dwelling perhaps make them susceptible to being trapped by resin and conserved. Kachinus magnificus, reported in six of the Scydmaeninae specimens from Spanish amber, is the oldest species formally described for the subfamily. Penarhytus tenebris and Prosolierus parvus come from the Penacerrada I amber deposit, Kachinus magnificus from the El Soplao amber deposit, and Cretasonoma corinformibus is found at both locations, in the Basque-Cantabrian Basin, on the northern Iberian Plate (today the Iberian Peninsula).

A new series of 19 specimens with excellent preservation allows description and redescription of virtually all morphological details. Male terminalia are very similar to those of the Holarctic Recent family of snow fleas:' the Boreidae. Thoracic sderites are highly convergent with nematocerous Diptera in the expansion of the mesothorax and great reduction of the proand metathoraces. The metathoracic wing vestige appears to be just the teg-ula; axial sderites are lost. Details of the pretarsal claws are described; in P paraburrniticus Grimaldi and Rasnitsyn the outer claw of the meso- and metathoracic pretarsi is elongate and the inner claw reduced. The proboscis is comprised not of a labial tube and pseudolabellum (contra Ren et al., 2009), but is mostly m'aiillary in tlrigin, with the outer valves probably being galeae and the central, serrated stylet probably the hypopharynx. Abdominal stemites are greatly reduced (more so in females), suggesting that the abdomen was distensible, a feature that is common in some fluid-feeding insects. The proboscis, claw, and sternite modifications indicate that Parapolycentropus fed on the hemolymph of small insects, not the blood of vertebrates.","[Grimaldi, David; Johnston, M.

This unique specimen, a well preserved female in Burmese amber from Myanmar, is described as Myanmariscus deboiseae gen. nov. sp. nov. It belongs to the clade Synocheta Legrand, 1946 based on the poorly differentiated flagellum of antenna, its small body size and underdeveloped eyes. Its familial position remains uncertain because this group is primarily classified using male reproductive structures. However, comparison with the biogeographical distribution of Recent species of Oniscidea suggests it most probably belongs to the Styloniscidae Vandel, 1952. This specimen and other records of Oniscidea in Cretaceous amber from East Europe indicate that this remarkable group of crustaceans was already highly diversified by the Cretaceous, thus supporting an earlier origin for the group. Finally, this strictly terrestrial Mesozoic isopod represents the earliest formal record of land colonization within Crustacea. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

It is noteworthy for the possession of a fully-developed CuP in the hind wing, a vein that is strongly reduced in all other species of the subfamily. The genus Spiroberotha is considered to belong to the Berothinae.","[Makarkin, Vladimir N.] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Biol & Soil Sci, Far East Branch, Vladivostok 960022, Russia; [Ohl, Michael] Leibniz Inst Evolut & Biodiversitatsforsch, Museum Nat Kunde, D-10115 Berlin, Germany","Makarkin, VN (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, Inst Biol & Soil Sci, Far East Branch, Vladivostok 960022, Russia.",Michael.Ohl@mfn-berlin.de; vnmakarkin@mail.ru,,,Leading Scientific Schools of the Russian FederationLeading Scientific Schools Program [HIII-150.2014.4]; Far Eastern Branch of the Russian Academy of SciencesRussian Academy of Sciences [12-I-II30-03],"We thank Carsten Grohn (Glinde, Germany) for allowing this research on the holotype specimen, performing photography, and answering our numerous questions; Thomas Weiterschan (Hochst Odw., Germany) for helpful information; Lukas Kirschey for help with photography of the paratype S.

It shows a unique combination of family characters and is provisionally referred to Cupedidae in the broad sense and possibly subfamily Ommatinae. The dorsal ornamentation and expanded elytra with window punctures make it a very distinctive albeit rare insect in this rich amber biota.

The nymphid Araripenymphes seldeni, from the Crato Formation, is redescribed on the basis of a new specimen, showing possible sexual dimorphism in wing coloration, a feature extremely rare among the Neuroptera. In a recently published phylogenetic analysis of the family, the attribution to the fossil taxa (versus rejection) of the larval characters proper to the modern nymphids, has a crucial impact on the resolution of the phylogeny. The compression fossils currently attributed to the Nymphidae should be revised because their wing venation alone is not really sufficient for an accurate family attribution to Nymphidae rather than to another family of Neuroptera (viz.

It shares several characters belonging to two Recent tribes (Eustrophini and Holostrophini), but it cannot be attributed to either of them. Together with other tetratomid genera from the Cretaceous, the new discovery implies that the Recent small family Tetratomidae is much more diverse and more widespread than previously documented. In addition, a morphological similarity between Cretosynstrophus and extant Synstrophus suggests a similar fungi feeding habit for Cretosynstrophus, highlighting an ancient association between tetratomid beetles and fungi in the Mesozoic.

The phylogenetic position of H. ocampoi was analyzed by employing 117 morphological characters and 44 extant/extinct species. The documented features are discussed and analyzed with respect to the phylogenetic placement of the species which may have a strong impact on the evolution in Hybosoridae and greatly expand our knowledge on the early evolution of Scarabaeoidea. Our finding provides solid evidence to prove the very old origin of the genus Hybosorus which is the type genus of Hybosoridae. Furthermore, this finding not only supports the hypothesis of Mesozoic origin of most families in Scarabaeoidea but also supports some genera of Scarabaeoidea might have already appeared in the Mesozoic.

Flabellotoma heidiae gen. et sp. nov. is the Mesozoic representative of the putatively primitive subfamily Pelecotominae, represented by an almost completely preserved male. The new genus is compared with all extant members of the subfamily and is most notably distinguishable by an autapomorphic combination of a reduced tibial spur formula and unique ventral abdominal sclerite, and presumably in antennal structure as well. In addition, a syninclusion of eight males of Ripidiinae is discussed. The males are similar to Paleoripiphorus deploegi Perrichot, Nel, et Neraudeau in roughly coeval amber from western France. The syninclusion is interpreted as a result of aggregative behaviour during the flight activity of males, thereby representing the earliest documented evidence of such ethology.

The possibility remains, however, that the species was hematophagous (possibly facultative), feeding on the hemolymph of arthropods or the blood of such thin-skinned vertebrates as frogs.

Passalopalpidae fam. nov., Passalopalpus cheni gen. et sp. nov., are probably extinct since a long time. Observations were made on the whole body (head, thorax, abdomen) and appendages (mouthparts, antennae, legs, wings). Most characters are remarkable and plesiomorphic, compared to Passalidae Leach, as well as to some other Scarabaeoidea. Morphological characteristics demonstrate that the fossil species is typically passaloid, but that it cannot belongs to Passalidae. Passalopalpidae and Passalidae are clearly distinct families, with strong assumption to be sister groups. The systematic interpretation of the fossil could fill a historic gap: the sister group of Passalidae had been established previously never in a solid way. Passalids are Gondwanian, whereas passalopalpids lived on former eastern Laurasia. Vicariance of both taxa, each on one of the super-continents, seems to support recent hypotheses of phylogeny and paleobiogeography for Passalidae. Other preliminary notes are given on the morphology, biology and phylogenetic relationships of passalopalpids. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Direct fossil evidence is lacking for this group. Here, I describe the first fossil of this peculiar subfamily, Protodasycerus aenigmaticus gen. and sp. n., from the Upper Cretaceous Burmese amber. Despite considerable external similarities to extant dasycerine species, this new genus possesses several important morphological differences: a much smaller body size (ca. 1.1 mm), narrowly elongate antennomeres 1 and 2, not strongly transverse metaventrite, elytra striate but not tricostate, and truncate posterior margin of the elytra exposing four abdominal tergites dorsally. The new finding of a Cretaceous representative of the Dasycerinae helps elucidate the origin and early evolution of the omaliine group subfamilies, implying rather close similarities between the Dasycerinae and the monobasic subfamily Neophoninae. Discovery of P. aenigmaticus suggests a rather ancient origin of the subfamily by the Upper Cretaceous. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

We performed a morphological examination of this fossil and determined that it does not belong to Pompilidae or any other described hymenopteran family. Instead, we place it in the new family Bryopompilidae. The oldest verifiable member of the Pompilidae is from Baltic amber, which suggests that the crown group of the family probably originated in the Eocene, not in the Late Cretaceous as previously proposed. The origin of spider wasps appears to be correlated with an increase in spider familial diversity in the Cenozoic.

However, while extinct representatives of much smaller extant tribes, as Clidicini, Eutheiini and Cephenniini, were described from Cretaceous deposits, named genera and species of Glandulariini were so far known only from much younger Baltic, Sicilian and Dominican ambers. Here we report the first genus and species of definite Glandulariini from the Upper Cretaceous Burmese amber, Scydmobisetia vetutissima Jaioszyfiski and Yamamoto, gen. and sp. nov. Scydmobisetia is the first known glandulariine beetle with a pair of very long vertexal sensilla chaetica, previously not found in this tribe, but common among unrelated Staphylinidae. The new genus shows similarities to the extant genera Anthicimimus, Sciacharis, Spinosciacharis and Horaeomorphus, but S. vetutissima has protibial modifications typical of males of some extant species of Euconnus.

The first species in amber, and the latest occurrence of the family, was recently described as Zhenia xiai, from the mid-Cretaceous of Myanmar, ca. 100 Ma. New observations of a finely preserved specimen allow refinement of the morphological interpretations in the original description. The female of Zhenia, for example, has the distinctive piercing oviscapt of the superfamily Archisargoidea, formed from modified cerci (not tergites 8 and 9 as originally reported). The pretarsus of Zhenia bears an enormous empodial pad and pair of pulvillae, but the claws are highly vestigial (contra Zhang et al., 2016). The fly was almost certainly a parasitoid. A cladistic analysis of 26 binary-state characters and six continuously variable characters, using 47 exemplar Archisargoidea species from most genera and all four families, and five outgroup Brachycera, has very poor support for most Glades but confirms the position of Zhenia in Eremochaetidae. Evidence on the relationships of Archisargoidea to other Brachycera is reviewed, and a close relationship to the Nemestrinoidea or Muscomorpha is best supported.

Specimens of Kachinus magnificus (originally placed as incertae sedis within Scydmaenitae) were re-examined and their characters were found different from those of the type species of Kachinus from Myanmar amber. Consequently, Archeutheia gen. nov. is proposed to accommodate the Spanish species, resulting in Archeutheia magmfica comb. nov. Moreover, in a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis Archeutheia was placed as a sister group to extant Eutheia, within the tribe Eutheiini of Cephenniitae. A specimen of an undetermined genus from Myanmar amber clearly belonging in Cephenniini is also recorded. Both taxa represent the first definite Cretaceous Cephenniitae, a supertribe whose recent members are distributed on all continents but are especially diverse in the Oriental and East Palaearctic regions. This finding demonstrates a diversification Of two presently most species-rich tribes of Cephenniitae already in Early Cretaceous. Archeutheia is strikingly similar to the extant species of Eutheia and Veraphis, showing male dimorphic characters (modified protrochanters) and antennal cavities characteristic of Palaearctic Eutheiini. This fact suggests a long morphological stability in the supertribe. A previously proposed hypothesis of an early presence of the Cephenniitae in the Northern Hemisphere is for the first time supported by the fossil record, and the palaeolocalities (western Europe and Southeast Asia) demonstrate a wide distribution of Cephenniitae in the Cretaceous and an early split of its ancestral lineage.

Here we provide a revision of the Spanish amber springtail fauna, Early Cretaceous (Late Albian) in age, based on 93 specimens sufficiently well preserved to permit specific identification. Three new species are erected within the Isotomidae: Anurophorinae. These are: Burmisotoma spinulifera, new species, Protoisotoma autrigoniensis, new species, and Proisotoma communis, new species. The two former are respectively placed in the Cretaceous genera Burmisotoma Christiansen and Nascimbene (previously known from Cenomanian Burmese amber) and Protoisotoma Christiansen and Pike (in both Burmese and Canadian ambers), while the last species is indistinguishable from the extant, cosmopolitan genus Proisotoma Borner (also recorded in Burmese amber). Low morphological intraspecific variability is described for P. communis. Taxa are discussed in relation to other fossil entomobryomorphan lineages as well as their modern counterparts. A catalog of the known fossil springtails is appended. Isotomidae are diverse springtails, putatively basal among Entomobryomorpha and extending back into the Early Devonian. Indeed, taxa described herein are overall remarkably similar to their extant relatives, emphasizing the antiquity and morphological stasis of the group as a whole.","[Sanchez-Garcia, Alba] Univ Barcelona, Fac Geol, Dept Dinam Terra & Ocea, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain; [Sanchez-Garcia, Alba] Univ Barcelona, Fac Geol, Inst Recerca Biodiversitat IRBio, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain; [Engel, Michael S.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Engel, Michael S.] Nat Hist Museum, New York, NY USA; [Engel, Michael S.] Univ Kansas, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA","Sanchez-Garcia, A (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Fac Geol, Dept Dinam Terra & Ocea, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain.; Sanchez-Garcia, A (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Fac Geol, Inst Recerca Biodiversitat IRBio, E-08007 Barcelona, Spain.",,"Engel, Michael S/C-5461-2012","Engel, Michael S/0000-0003-3067-077X; Sanchez-Garcia, Alba/0000-0003-0911-2001",Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness; project: Iberian amber: an exceptional record of Cretaceous forests in the rise of modern terrestrial ecosystems [CGL2014-52163],"The authors express their sincere gratitude to the director and staff of the Museo de Ciencias Naturales de Alava for permitting our loan of the Spanish amber specimens discussed herein; to Rafael Lopez del Valle for the careful preparation of the pieces; to Mari-Mutt for information on the disposition of his collection; and to two reviewers for their helpful advice.

Consequently, tracking mouthpart innovation in insects is one of the keys toward understanding their diversification. In hemipteroid insects (clade Paraneoptera or Acercaria: lice, thrips, aphids, cicadas, bugs, etc.), the transition from chewing to piercing-and-sucking mouthparts is widely regarded as the turning point that enabled hyperdiversification of the Hemiptera, the fifth largest insect order. However, the transitional process from chewing to piercing-and-sucking in the Paraneoptera was hitherto completely unknown. In this paper, we report a well preserved mid Cretaceous amber fossil of the paraneopteran insect family Archipsyllidae and describe it as Mydiognathus eviohlhoffae gen. et sp. n. This species has elongate mandibles and styliform laciniae similar to Hemiptera but retains functional chewing mouthparts. A number of morphological characters place the Archipsyllidae as the sister group of the thrips plus hemipterans, which strongly suggests that the mouthparts of M. eviohlhoffae represent a transitional condition from primitive chewing to derived piercing-and-sucking mouthparts. The clade composed of Archipsyllidae, thrips, and hemipterans is here named Pancondylognatha, a new supra-ordinal taxon. Based on newly obtained information, we also assess the monophyly of the Paraneoptera, which was called into question by recent phylogenomic analyses. A phylogenetic analysis that includes Mydiognathus strongly supports the monophyly of the Paraneoptera.","[Yoshizawa, Kazunori] Hokkaido Univ, Sch Agr, Systemat Entomol, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608589, Japan; [Lienhard, Charles] Nat Hist Museum City Geneva, CP 6434, CH-1211 Geneva 6, Switzerland","Yoshizawa, K (corresponding author), Hokkaido Univ, Sch Agr, Systemat Entomol, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0608589, Japan.",psocid@res.agr.hokudai.ac.jp,"Yoshizawa, Kazunori/Q-9390-2019; Yoshizawa, Kazunori/A-4268-2012","Yoshizawa, Kazunori/0000-0001-6170-4296; ","JSPSMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [15H04409]","We thank Rainer Ohlhoff for giving us the opportunity to examine this exceptionally valuable amber fossil for this study and John Hollier for discussion and language editing.

Deducing the factors that drove pselaphine diversification and their evolutionary predisposition to inquilinism requires a reliable timescale of pselaphine cladogenesis. Pselaphinae is split into a small and highly plesiomorphic supertribe, Faronitae, and its sister group, the higher Pselaphinae' - a vast multi-tribe clade with a more derived morphological ground plan, and which includes all known instances of inquilinism. The higher Pselaphinae is dominated by tribes with a Gondwanan taxonomic bias. However, a minority of tribes are limited to the Nearctic and Palearctic ecozones, implying a potentially older, Pangaean origin of the higher Pselaphinae as a whole. Here, I describe fossils from mid-Cretaceous (approximate to 99 million years old) Burmese amber that confirm the existence of crown-group higher pselaphines on the Eurasian supercontinent prior to contact with Gondwanan landmasses. Protrichonyx rafifronsgen. et sp.n. is placed incertae sedis within the higher Pselaphinae. Boreotethysgen.n., erected for B. grimaldiisp.n. and B. arctopteryxsp.n., represents an extinct sister taxon and putative stem group of Bythinini, a Recent tribe with a primarily Holarctic distribution. The Laurasian palaeolocality of the newly described taxa implies that higher pselaphines are indeed probably of Jurassic, Pangaean extraction and that the Laurasian-Gondwanan tribal dichotomy of this clade may have developed vicariantly following Pangaean rifting. Higher pselaphines probably predate the earliest ants. Their physically protective morphological ground plan may have been a preadaptation for myrmecophily when ants became diverse and ecologically ubiquitous, much later in the Cenozoic.

Previous work suggested it was most closely related to the modern and widespread European sheep tick Ixodes ricinus (Linneaus, 1758). Results: Restudy using phase contrast synchrotron x-ray tomography yielded images of exceptional quality. These confirm the fossil's referral to Ixodes Latreille, 1795, but the characters resolved here suggest instead affinities with the Asian subgenus Partipalpiger Hoogstraal et al., 1973 and its single living (and medically significant) species Ixodes ovatus Neumann, 1899. We redescribe the amber fossil here as Ixodes (Partipalpiger) succineus. Conclusions: Our data suggest that Ixodes ricinus is unlikely to be directly derived from Weidner's amber species, but instead reveals that the Partipalpiger lineage was originally more widely distributed across the northern hemisphere. The closeness of Ixodes (P.) succineus to a living vector of a wide range of pathogens offers the potential to correlate its spatial and temporal position (northern Europe, nearly 50 million years ago) with the estimated origination dates of various tick-borne diseases.","[Dunlop, Jason A.] Leibniz Inst Res Evolut & Biodivers, Museum Nat Kunde, Invalidenstr 43, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Apanaskevich, Dmitry A.] Georgia Southern Univ, James H Oliver Jr Inst Coastal Plain Sci, US Natl Tick Collect, Statesboro, GA 30460 USA; [Lehmann, Jens] Univ Bremen, Fac Geosci, D-28357 Bremen, Germany; [Hoffmann, Rene] Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Geol Mineral & Geophys, Dept Earth Sci, D-44801 Bochum, Germany; [Fusseis, Florian] Univ Edinburgh, Grant Inst, Sch Geosci, Kings Bldg,West Mains Rd, Edinburgh EH9 3JW, Midlothian, Scotland; [Ehlke, Moritz; Zachow, Stefan] Zuse Inst Berlin, Dept Visualizat & Data Anal, Med Planning Grp, D-14195 Berlin, Germany; [Xiao, Xianghui] Argonne Natl Lab, Adv Photon Source, 9700 S Cass Ave, Lemont, IL 60439 USA","Dunlop, JA (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Res Evolut & Biodivers, Museum Nat Kunde, Invalidenstr 43, D-10115 Berlin, Germany.",jason.dunlop@mfn-berlin.de,"Lehmann, Jens/A-6516-2009; Dunlop, Jason A./AAC-8042-2019; Fusseis, Florian/M-5321-2016","Fusseis, Florian/0000-0002-3104-8109; Lehmann, Jens/0000-0001-6580-6644",U.S. Department of EnergyUnited States Department of Energy (DOE) [DE-AC02-06CH11357]; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious DiseasesUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R15AI096317]; NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASESUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Allergy & Infectious Diseases (NIAID) [R15AI096317] Funding Source: NIH RePORTER,"We appreciate technical support by M.

Fungus-feeding, or mycophagy, is remarkably widespread in beetles (Coleoptera) and appears to be a primitive feeding habit that preceded feeding on plant tissues. Numerous Mesozoic beetles belonging to extant fungus-associated families are known, but direct fossil evidence elucidating mycophagy in insects has remained elusive. Here, we report a remarkable genus and species, Vetuproteinus cretaceus gen. et sp. nov., belonging to a newtribe (Vetuproteinini trib. nov.) of the extant rove beetle subfamily Proteininae (Staphylinidae) in Mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber. The mouthparts of this beetle have a markedly enlarged protruding galea bearing an apparent spore brush, a specialized structure we infer was used to scrape spores off surfaces and direct them into the mouth, as in multiple modern spore-feeding beetles. Considering the long evolutionary history of Fungi, the Mid-Cretaceous beetles likely fed on ancient Basidiomycota and/or Ascomycota fungi or spore-producing organisms such as slime moulds (Myxomycetes). The discovery of the first Mesozoic proteinine illustrates the antiquity of the subfamily, and suggests that ancestral Proteininae were already diverse and widespread in Pangaea before the supercontinent broke up.","[Cai, Chenyang] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, Key Lab Econ Stratig & Palaeogeog, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Cai, Chenyang; Huang, Diying] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Newton, Alfred F.; Thayer, Margaret K.] Field Museum Nat Hist, Integrat Res Ctr, 1400 S Lake Shore Dr, Chicago, IL 60605 USA; [Leschen, Richard A.

It represents a stem lineage valuable for the study of the early diversification of Staphylinidae, where sister group relationships of Megalopsidiinae currently remain a big controversy. This discovery corroborates the Mesozoic origin of this subfamily implied by its presumably basal phylogenetic position within Staphylinidae and hitherto available fossil record for the family. Well preserved peculiar mouthparts of M. extinctus specialized similarly with recent Megalopinus suggest the same mode of feeding in Megalopsidiinae for nearly a hundred million years.

This species is characterized by the rather small body size (0.59 mm) and structural similarities with different staphylinoid groups. The particular development of the legs of the new taxa shows some similarities with those of small and medium-sized jumping beetles from the superfamilies Scirtoidea, Buprestoidea, Tenebrionoidea, Chrysomeloidea and Curculionoidea. However, jumping beetles of these groups have strong femora and tibiae with large spurs and thick apical setae only on the posterior legs while P. zasukhae sp. nov. demonstrates such features on both mid and posterior legs. Another particularity of P. zasukhae sp. nov. is the unusual large femoral plate of metacoxae extending behind the suture between ventrites 2 and 3. Strong development of these structures are rare among Coleoptera and occurs in different taxonomic groups without close relationship. The studies were carried out with the usage of usual conventional light microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This aphid, herein named Koonwarraphis rotundafrons gen. & sp. nov., is assigned to the cosmopolitan Cretaceous superfamily Tajmyraphidoidea, which has been previously described from the Lebanese, Taimyrian, Canadian, Myanmar (Burmese), and Spanish ambers. Koonwarraphis rotundafrons is the first aphid recorded from the eastern Gondwanan landmass during the Cretaceous, and represents the only tajmyraphidoid preserved as a compression fossil, rather than as an amber inclusion. Due to the nature of the fossil's preservation, Koonwarraphis cannot be firmly placed in any of the described tajmyraphidoid families; however, all observable morphological features suggest that the genus is broadly typical of the superfamily and Cretaceous aphids in general. Koonwarraphis' shortened rostrum, a feature also seen in other tajmyraphidoids, suggests an association with the more herbaceous aspects of the Early Cretaceous Victorian flora. Considering the modern aphid preference for angiosperm plants, it is possible that this aphid was living upon the herbaceous early angiosperms recorded previously from the Koonwarra macrofloral assemblage.","[Martin, Sarah K.] Geol Survey Western Australia, 100 Plain St, East Perth, WA 6004, Australia; [Martin, Sarah K.] Western Australian Museum, Earth & Planetary Sci, Welshpool, WA 6101, Australia; [Skidmore, Luke I.] Dept Educ Tasmania, 73 Murray St, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia; [Stilwell, Jeffrey D.] Monash Univ, Sch Earth Atmosphere & Environm, Clayton, Vic 3800, Australia; [Stilwell, Jeffrey D.] Australian Museum, 1 William St, Sydney, NSW 2010, Australia","Martin, SK (corresponding author), Geol Survey Western Australia, 100 Plain St, East Perth, WA 6004, Australia.; Martin, SK (corresponding author), Western Australian Museum, Earth & Planetary Sci, Welshpool, WA 6101, Australia.",martin.sarahk@gmail.com; l.i.skidmore@hotmail.com; jeffrey.stilwell@monash.edu,,"Stilwell, Jeffrey Darl/0000-0002-9853-1322",Monash UniversityMonash University; Australian Museum; Monash Research Initiatives grant,LIS Honours' work was sponsored by Monash University and a 2010 Geddes Post-graduate Award from the Australian Museum.

Arthropod bearing Cretaceous resin sites are reviewed, and a list of arthropod records (identified to the family level) published up to 2015 is provided. Also, new records of mites, and new arthropod records from the Siberian resins are given. An efficient method for extracting amber from loose sediments in situations of limited infrastructure but easy access to water is described as well. The sequence of arthropod assemblages in Cretaceous resins according to their evolutionary aspect does not match their geological sequence. This can be only partly explained by taphonomic constraints and inadequacy of the material: there is a deeper difference between somewhat contemporary assemblages than was characteristic of Permian assemblages studied in a similar way in previous studies. Our results confirm the earlier hypothesis that the Palaeozoic-Mesozoic biotic crisis was not so much a mass extinction as a biotic reorganisation that opened the way to diversification. These results might indicate a peculiar feature of the immediate effects of such reorganisations, namely that Mesozoic-Cenozoic communities became differentiated in their compositions much deeper than Palaeozoic ones (i.e., that their constituent groups acquired the ability to evolve much deeper changes while adapting to the ecological specifics of their environments). A transformation of organisms and/or their communities took place, comparable in scope to the rise of skeletal fauna in the Cambrian. The difference between these two transformations is that the later one resulted not from a particular adaptation (the skeleton) but from the ability to specialize more deeply than was possible in the Palaeozoic.

Its features come very close to the presumptive groundplan of the order suggested in recent studies. Preserved plesiomorphic features are the following: fully sclerotized head with long coronal suture, small ommatidia not separated by chitinous bridges, absence of microtrichia between ommatidia, eight antennomeres, robust mandibles with dicondylic articulation, galea distinctly developed, free pro-and mesotrochanters, slender five-segmented tarsi without adhesive soles, and equally sclerotized abdominal tergites and sternites. An important character that is not recognizable due to damage is the shape of the metapostnotum. This structure is transverse in the groundplan of Strepsiptera and in + Protoxenos, but elongated and shield-like in all other known strepsipterans. In a cladistic analyses of 82 characters of adult males and additional characters for females and immatures (scored as unknown for all included fossils) + Kinzelbachilla is placed as sister group of all remaining strepsipterans except for + Protoxenos, followed by + Cretostylops and + Mengea as the third and fourth branches in the stem group, respectively. The position of + Protoxenos as first branch is suggested by three unambiguous apomorphic features of all remaining Strepsiptera, the reduced size of less than 6 mm, mandibles distinctly narrowing distad the basalmost part, and fan-shaped hindwings which are broader than they are long.

Gynapteromyia brevipalpis (Mamaev, 1964) comb. nov., G. heteroptera (Mamaev & Spungis, 1980) comb. nov., G. hondrui (Mamaev, 1964) comb. nov., G. indica (Grover, 1971) comb. nov., G. longipalpis (Mamaev, 1964) comb. nov., and G. stricta (Fedotova & Sidorenko, 2005) comb. nov. are all new combinations. dagger Palaeocolpodia eocenica Meunier, 1904 is considered to be a nomen dubium. Prior to the present study, the tribe Diallactiini contained 28 extant species classified in 6 genera. Previously unworked specimens of Diallactiini gathered by the author in the past 15 years were examined and identified as belonging to 57 different species, all unnamed. From that material, the following new taxa are described: Bruneiplusia gen. nov. (from Brunei), B. kaspraki sp. nov., Gynapteromyia costaricensis sp. nov. (Costa Rica), G. furcata sp. nov. (Costa Rica), G. novaezealandiae sp. nov. (New Zealand), G. tasmanica sp. nov. (Australia), G. temburong sp. nov. (Brunei), G. tenuistylata sp. nov. (Brunei), Haplusia afrotropica sp. nov. (South Africa), Japoplusia gen. nov. (Japan), Jap. honshuensis sp. nov., Johnsonomyia scabra sp. nov. (Costa Rica), John. serrata sp. nov. (South Africa), Loboplusia gen. nov. (Costa Rica), L. zurqui sp. nov., Makrostyles gen. nov. (Costa Rica), Makr. terrifica sp. nov., Mikrostyles gen. nov. (Brunei), Mikr. angustilobata sp. nov., Mikr. latolobata sp. nov., Wahabia gen. nov. (Brunei), Wah. mantici sp. nov., and Wyattella japonica sp. nov. (Japan). A key to the genera of Diallactiini based on male characters is presented. Diallactiini are shown to be a remarkably diverse group in terms of adult morphology. The genitalia of some male Diallactiini represent the most strongly modified such structures known in Winnertziinae. Morphological novelties found in Diallactiini, but no other Cecidomyiidae, include the fringed leg setae of Loboplusia and the furcate palpal sensilla in some Gynapteromyia and Mikrostyles. Diallactiini occur in all zoogeographic regions, with the highest generic and specific diversity found in the tropics (although Afrotropical diallactiines are poorly researched). Local diversity is also highest in the tropics, with as many as 29 species (unnamed or named in this paper) of at least 6 genera found at a single site, Zurqui de Moravia, in the cloud forest of Costa Rica. The best-explored fauna of Winnertziinae, including Diallactiini, is certainly that of Europe, but diallactiine biodiversity there is low and most of the nine European species are rarely encountered in the field. Gynapteromyia brevipalpis is reported from Sweden for the first time.","[Jaschhof, Mathias] Stn Linne, Olands Skogsby 161, SE-38693 Farjestaden, Sweden","Jaschhof, M (corresponding author), Stn Linne, Olands Skogsby 161, SE-38693 Farjestaden, Sweden.",mjaschhof@yahoo.de,,,Svenska ArtDatabanken; Swedish Species Information Centre; Swedish Taxonomy Initiative [dha 2014-150 4.3]; U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1145890],"This study was performed as part of the Gall Midge Project, which is funded by Svenska ArtDatabanken, The Swedish Species Information Centre, within the framework of Svenska Artprojektet, The Swedish Taxonomy Initiative (dha 2014-150 4.3).

It is undoubtedly placed in extant subfamily Malthininae based on its small-sized body, somewhat abbreviated elytra and fusiform terminal maxillary palpomere, representing the oldest documented occurrence of Malthininae. It suggests that this subfamily is an ancient group, which originated at least in the earliest Late Cretaceous. Our discovery sheds light on the palaeodiversity of Cantharidae in the Late Mesozoic. Together with other previously reported fossil cantharids, it is likely that Malthininae has been fairly diverse during the early evolution of Cantharidae. On the other hand, a morphological similarity between Archaeomalthodes and Recent malthinines and the occurrence of flowering plants in the Burmese amber implies a potential flower-visiting behaviour of this fossil species.

It can be readily distinguished from all other members of Hemiphlebiidae in having very short MP and CuA veins, and in its rectangular discoidal cell. The new fossils support the view that hemiphlebiid damselflies were one of the dominant groups of Zygoptera during the Mesozoic. Palaeodysagrion cretacicus is the first dysagrionid damselfly from Burmese amber and the second Mesozoic representative of this predominantly Paleogene group.

However, there is a gap in the Mesozoic, with only slightly more than a dozen fossils being known, until the much more recent fossil records mainly from Cenozoic Dominican and Baltic ambers become available. Burmese amber, precisely dated to the Late Cretaceous, is known for an apparently rich but still undescribed millipede fauna, and might represent the ideal bridge to close this gap in the millipede fossil record. In addition, modern micro-computed tomography (mu CT) technology allows complex 3D reconstructions of objects fossilized in amber. Here we utilize mu CT technology to describe the first millipedes from Burmese amber, which are also the first two fossil representatives of the order Siphoniulida. Siphoniulida, with two known species and just nine recorded specimens, are the rarest and least known of the 16 extant orders of the Diplopoda. Records are known from Sumatra, Guatemala and Mexico. The two new fossils described here represent two distinct species, Siphoniulus muelleri sp. nov. and S. preciosus sp. nov., and indicate a wider distribution of this order in the Cretaceous. The holotype of S. muelleri sp. nov. was well enough preserved so that characters of the head, such as the incisura lateralis, not investigated before in extant representatives of the order, could be studied. This study highlights the possibilities and challenges provided by mu CT technology in investigating Diplopoda fossilized in amber. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Diagnostic characters of the female Aptenoperissus burmanicus sp. et gen. nov. include its wingless, streamlined and heavily sclerotized body lacking any apparent trace of a wasp waist, and geniculate antenna composed of a long, thin, stick-like scape, standard pedicel and 22 uniform flagellomeres. Also the body has 9 externally visible segments with no evidence of segment fusion implying the presence of a completely hidden segment. All tibiae have paired spurs and the hind femora are saltatory and incrassate. The double fore-tibial spur combined with unquestionable diagnostic features of Apocrita (primarily an internalized needle-like thin and acute ovipositor) suggest placement within the super family Ceraphronoidea s.str. with the Maimetshidae as a sister group of the crown Ceraphronoidea, composed of the Ceraphronidae, Megaspilidae, Stigmaphronidae, and Radiophronidae. The fossil is hypothesized to live semicryptically on the forest floor or tree trunk and to parasitize immature holometabolous insects.

They are considered to belong to two new subfamilies, Cretanallachiinae subfam. nov. and Cretadilarinae subfam. nov., respectively. These subfamilies are easily distinguished from other dilarids (Dilarinae, Nallachiinae, and Berothellinae) by possessing siphonate mouthparts; however they strongly differ from each other. In particular, the broad gonocoxites 9 of Cretanallachiinae females are not fused to form a distinct ovipositor, and bear long gonostyli, whereas a distinct saber-like ovipositor (short, lacking gonostyli) is present in Cretadilarinae.

Furthermore, the mesonotum of Pseudoperla leptoclada sp. nov. is rectangular and considerably longer than pronotum vs. mesonotum is quadrate and slightly shorter than pronotum in P. gracilipes.

The remarkable degree of homoplastic conflict in the wing venational similarities indicates that these represent relatively weak evidence for phylogenetic relationships. The palaeoecology, including sexual dimorphism in wing colouration, of the new taxon is discussed, and the large number of inclusions explained with possible breeding behaviour in association with water-filled tree holes (phytotelmata) of the amber tree, similar to extant Pseudostigmatinae. The position of all alleged fossil Thaumatoneuridae are discussed and revised: Eothaumatoneura ptychoptera Pongracz, 1935 from the Eocene Geiseltal locality is restored in Thaumatoneuridae.

The results indicate that Schlettereriinae and Stephaninae are monophyletic, whereas ElectrostephanusBrues, as the only genus within Electrostephaninae, belongs to Stephaninae. Therefore, we propose a synonymy of Electrostephaninae with Stephaninae.

The subfamily is monotypic with a single genus Buchonomyia, including three Recent species from Europe, South-East Asia and Central America, and a single fossil species, B. succinea Seredszus and Wichard, 2002, from Baltic amber. The elusive nature of the larvae and pupae, who develop as parasites or are commensal of caddisfly larvae, means that records of recent Buchonomyiinae extremely rare. From the latest dated phylogeny of the Chironomidae, the Buchonomyiinae branched from the rest of the Chironomidae in the Early to Middle Jurassic. Here we present the oldest record of the subfamily Buchonomyiinae, from Upper Cretaceous Burmese amber. The record is represented by a new genus Furcobuchonomyia, with a single species E saetheri sp. nov. Bayesian analysis firmly places the new genus as the sister group to the rest of the Buchonomyiinae. Thus the discovery of this genus is shedding new light on the origin of the most basal group of the Chironomidae. A species level key to the subfamily is included. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This peculiar fossil is tentatively attributed to the order Strepsiptera, representing the first record of this lineage from these deposits. Planidia of a similar conicocephalate form are known from the slightly younger amber of western Canada (Campanian) as well as in the earlier (Cenomanian) amber of Myanmar, and comparisons are made with those fossils, as well as with living Strepsiptera and the beetle family Ripiphoridae (Tenebrionoidea). Given recent debate concerning the strepsipteran attribution of these planidia, we provide some discussion about the available and expected character evidence, and tend to believe assignment to Ripiphoridae is untenable. While placement with Strepsiptera remains difficult to state conclusively, the current limited evidence still tends to prefer the strepsipteran hypothesis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The family Tarachocelidae previously described from Burmese amber and then placed in Amphiesmenoptera incertae sedis is assigned to this new order. The genus Kinitocelis gen. nov. is established to accommodate three new fossil species: K. hennigi spec. nov., K. divisinotata spec. nov. and K. brevicostata spec. nov. The new genus differs from Tarachocelis gen. nov. by the absence of androconial scales on the wings and the loss of Cu2 in the forewings. The species are described in detail and the critical characters are illustrated by line drawings and photos. Both males and females were described. The species can be distinguished by traits in the wing venation. The new order Tarachoptera is placed in the super-order Amphiesmenoptera based on the presence of seven amphiesmenopteran apomorphies and nine tarachopteran apomorphies. Apomorphic characters of Trichoptera and Lepidoptera could not be disclosed, which suggests an independent origin and evolution from an amphiesmenopteran ancestor which was not the ancestor of the Trichoptera-Lepidoptera clade. The species of Tarachoptera are tiny insects with a wing span of 2.3-4.5mm but highly specialized according to their aberrant morphology. Aspects of the presumed life history of the adults were deduced from some of the derived morphological traits that could be interpreted as adaptations to a highly structured micro-environment.","[Mey, Wolfram] Humboldt Univ, Leibniz Inst Evolut & Biodivers Res, Museum Nat Kunde, Invalidenstr 43, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Wichard, Wilfried] Univ Cologne, Inst Biol, Gronewaldstr 2, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; [Mueller, Patrick] Friedhofstr 9, D-66894 Kashofen, Germany; [Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Mey, W (corresponding author), Humboldt Univ, Leibniz Inst Evolut & Biodivers Res, Museum Nat Kunde, Invalidenstr 43, D-10115 Berlin, Germany.; Wichard, W (corresponding author), Univ Cologne, Inst Biol, Gronewaldstr 2, D-50931 Cologne, Germany.; Muller, P (corresponding author), Friedhofstr 9, D-66894 Kashofen, Germany.; Wang, B (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Wang, B (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.",wolfram.mey@mfn-berlin.de; wichard@uni-koeln.de; pat14789@web.de; bowang@nigpas.ac.cn,,,"Museum for Naturkunde, Berlin; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41572010, 41622201]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of CAS [2011224]; Alexander von Humboldt FoundationAlexander von Humboldt Foundation","Our sincere thanks go to Jason Dunlop (MfN, Berlin) for the correction of the English text of the first draft of the manuscript.

Here we report the second genus of Glandulariini from Upper Cretaceous Burmese amber, Cenomaniola Jaloszynski and Yamamoto, gen. nov., with two species, C. carinata Jaloszynski and Yamamoto, sp. nov. and C macrophthalma Jaloszynski and Yamamoto, sp. nov. Cenomaniola shows the general body plan typical of the 'Euconnus complex' within Glandulariini, with thick bristles on the sides of head and pronotum, a character conserved for nearly a hundred million years. With the previous discovery of Scydmobisetia Jaloszyfiski and Yamamoto, two major body forms typical of the extant Glandulariini are already proved to have differentiated in or before the Late Cretaceous. This demonstrates early origins and a long conservation of 'Euconnus-like' and 'Sciacharis/Horaeomorphus-like' body plan in the currently largest group among Scydmaeninae. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we describe a new taxon of Corydasialidae - Megalopteroneura chenxingi gen. et sp. nov. - based on an exquisitely preserved specimen in mid-Cretaceous (Albian-Cenomanian) amber of Myanmar. The new corydasialid in general resembles the genus Cratochrysa Martins-Neto, 1994 (Neuroptera: familia incertae sedis) from the Early Cretaceous Crato Formation of Brazil. In light of the new fossil evidence, Corydasialidae is herein transferred from Megaloptera to Neuroptera based on sharing the following autapomorphies of the latter order: orthognathous head, absence of gula, distinctly enlarged prementum of labium, and short forewing ScA terminating on ScP. Male genitalia of M. chenxingi gen. et sp. nov. are superficially Raphidioptera-like, with well-developed male gonocoxites and gonapophyses 9 but lacking rosette of trichobothria on ectoprocts. However, male genital characters of the new corydasialid differ fundamentally from Raphidioptera in the separation of tergum and sternum 9, fusion between tergum 9 and ectoprocts, and fusion between sterna 8 and 9. These genital features, together with some wing characters, suggest a possible close relationship between Corydasialidae and Chrysopidae or Mesochrysopidae. The new corydasialid fossil, representing the first extinct lacewing family with completely preserved male genitalia, provides insight into the comparative morphology of genital sclerites in Neuropterida, and further elucidates the early evolution of lacewings.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:FD949294-59E3-455E-AABA-3E10D9B582D6","[Liu, Xingyue; Lu, Xiumei] China Agr Univ, Dept Entomol, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Weiwei] Three Gorges Entomol Museum, POB 4680, Chongqing 400015, Peoples R China","Liu, XY (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Dept Entomol, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",xingyue_liu@yahoo.com,"Liu, Xingyue/A-3019-2013","Liu, Xingyue/0000-0002-9168-0659; Lu, Xiumei/0000-0002-3494-7871","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31322501, 41271063]",We thank Ulrike Aspock (Vienna) and an anonymous reviewer who kindly provided valuable comments to help improve the manuscript.

We present the first Cretaceous fossil of the predominantly epiphytic leafy liverwort genus Radula in ca. 100 Myr old Burmese amber. The fossil's exquisite preservation allows first insights into the morphology of early crown group representatives of Radula occurring in gymnosperm-dominated forests. Ancestral character state reconstruction aligns the fossil with the crown group of Radula subg. Odontoradula; however, corresponding divergence time estimates using the software BEAST lead to unrealistically old age estimates. Alternatively, assignment of the fossil to the stem of subg. Odontoradula results in a stem age estimate of Radula of 227.8Ma (95% highest posterior density (HPD): 165.7-306.7) and a crown group estimate of 176.3Ma (135.1-227.4), in agreement with analyses employing standard substitution rates (stem age 235.6 Ma (142.9-368.5), crown group age 183.8 Ma (109.9-289.1)). The fossil likely belongs to the stem lineage of Radula subg. Odontoradula. The fossil's modern morphology suggests that switches from gymnosperm to angiosperm phorophytes occurred without changes in plant body plans in epiphytic liverworts. The fossil provides evidence for striking morphological homoplasy in time. Even conservative node assignments of the fossil support older rather than younger age estimates of the Radula crown group, involving origins for most extant subgenera by the end of the Cretaceous and diversification of their crown groups in the Cenozoic.","[Bechteler, Julia; Perez-Escobar, Oscar Alejandro; Feldberg, Kathrin; Heinrichs, Jochen] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Biol & GeoBioctr, Menzinger Str 67, D-80638 Munich, Germany; [Schmidt, Alexander R.] Georg August Univ, Dept Geobiol, Goldschmidtstr 3, D-37077 Gottingen, Germany; [Renner, Matthew A.

They are major contributors to modern terrestrial ecosystems, and have a deep evolutionary history. Whip spiders (Arachnida, Amblypygi), are one of the smaller arachnid orders with ca. 190 living species. Here we restudy one of the oldest fossil representatives of the group, Graeophonus anglicus Pocock, 1911 from the Late Carboniferous (Duckmantian, ca. 315 Ma) British Middle Coal Measures of the West Midlands, UK. Using X-ray microtomography, our principal aim was to resolve details of the limbs and mouthparts which would allow us to test whether this fossil belongs in the extant, relict family Paracharontidae; represented today by a single, blind species Paracharon caecus Hansen, 1921. Results: Tomography reveals several novel and significant character states for G. anglicus; most notably in the chelicerae, pedipalps and walking legs. These allowed it to be scored into a phylogenetic analysis together with the recently described Paracharonopsis cambayensis Engel & Grimaldi, 2014 from the Eocene (ca. 52 Ma) Cambay amber, and Kronocharon prendinii Engel & Grimaldi, 2014 from Cretaceous (ca. 99 Ma) Burmese amber. We recovered relationships of the form ((Graeophonus (Paracharonopsis + Paracharon)) + (Charinus (Stygophrynus (Kronocharon (Charon (Musicodamon + Paraphrynus)))))). This tree largely reflects Peter Weygoldt's 1996 classification with its basic split into Paleoamblypygi and Euamblypygi lineages; we were able to score several of his characters for the first time in fossils. Our analysis draws into question the monophyly of the family Charontidae. Conclusions: Our data suggest that Graeophonus is a crown group amblypygid, and falls within a monophyletic Paleoamblypgi clade, but outside the family Paracharontidae (= Paracharonopsis + Paracharon). Our results also suggest a new placement for the Burmese amber genus Kronocharon, a node further down from its original position. Overall, we offer a broad phylogenetic framework for both the fossil and Recent whip spiders against which future discoveries can be tested.","[Garwood, Russell J.] Univ Manchester, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England; [Garwood, Russell J.] Nat Hist Museum, Dept Earth Sci, Cromwell Rd, London SW7 5BD, England; [Dunlop, Jason A.] Leibniz Inst Res Evolut & Biodivers, Museum Nat Kunde, Invalidenstr 43, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Knecht, Brian J.; Hegna, Thomas A.] Western Illinois Univ, Dept Geol, Tillman Hall 113,1 Univ Circle, Macomb, IL 61455 USA","Garwood, RJ (corresponding author), Univ Manchester, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Manchester M13 9PL, Lancs, England.; Garwood, RJ (corresponding author), Nat Hist Museum, Dept Earth Sci, Cromwell Rd, London SW7 5BD, England.",russell.garwood@manchester.ac.uk,"Hegna, Thomas/X-3568-2019; Dunlop, Jason A./AAC-8042-2019","Hegna, Thomas/0000-0001-9067-8787; Garwood, Russell/0000-0002-2803-9471","European Union SYNTHESYS grant; EPSRCUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/F007906/1, EP/F001452/1, EP/I02249X/1]; WIU Undergraduate Research Grant; WIU Department of Geology; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research CouncilUK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) [EP/F007906/1, EP/I02249X/1, EP/F001452/1] Funding Source: researchfish","RJG's visit to Berlin was supported by a European Union SYNTHESYS grant.

Cybella n. gen. is proposed for Cybella deharvengi n. sp. (type species), collected from an isolated limestone hill in Hon Chong Province, Vietnam, and C. bedosae n. sp., found in a limestone cave in Kampuchea, Cambodia. Cybella species seem to be restricted to karst formations and are probably troglophilic. The type localities of the two known species are threatened by quarrying activities, these being particularly pressing in the case of C. deharvengi n. sp. Cybella shows important differences from other Feaellidae that require a modification of the familial diagnosis and justify the erection of a new subfamily, Cybellinae. The discovery of this group provides insights into the evolution of the unusual morphology of the family, notably concerning the pleural plates of Feaellinae, which are lacking in Cybellinae. The smaller sclerites of the pleura of Pseudogarypidae and Feaellidae are shown to be muscle apodemes, which provide an additional synapomorphy for Feaelloidea. Two types of coxal spines, termed primary and secondary, are distinguished in Feaelloidea, based on the presence of a lumen within the primary spines and its absence in secondary spines. The new morphological term atrial plate is proposed for a sclerotized plate of the male genitalia, extending between the lateral rods and the lateral apodemes. Claims that the internal genital setae of males of non-chthonioid pseudoscorpions are secretory are reviewed and found to lack support. Additional information concerning the fossil genus Protofeaella Henderickx, 2016 is provided, based on an adult male in amber from the Cretaceous (lowermost Cenomanian) of Myanmar. Protofeaella shares with Cybella the absence of pleural plates and the antiaxial position of the chemosensory setae of the movable chelal finger. However, it differs from both Cybellinae and Feaellinae in having relatively long chelal fingers that lack a tuberculate basal tooth, both of which are interpreted as symplesiomorphic states within Feaellidae. Protofeaella is therefore provisionally treated as a stem-group feaellid and not assigned to a subfamily. The existence of a Cretaceous member of the Pseudogarypidae is noted in the mid-Cretaceous (late Albian-early Cenomanian) of Germany, representing the oldest record of this family.","[Judson, Mark L.

These arachnids have a long evolutionary history but their origins and phylogenetic affinities are still being debated. Here, we summarise their fossil record based on a comprehensive review of the literature and data contained in other sources. Pseudoscorpions are one of the oldest colonisers of the land, with fossils known since the Middle Devonian (ca. 390 Ma). The only arachnid orders with an older fossil record are scorpions, harvestmen and acariform mites, plus two extinct groups. Pseudoscorpions do not fossilise easily, and records from the Mesozoic and Cenozoic consist almost exclusively of amber inclusions. Most Mesozoic fossils come from Archingeay and Burmese ambers (Late Cretaceous) and those from the Cenozoic are primarily from Eocene Baltic amber, although additional fossils from, for example, Miocene Dominican and Mexican ambers, are known. Overall, 16 of the 26 families of living pseudoscorpions have been documented from fossils and 49 currently valid species are recognised in the literature. Pseudoscorpions represent a case of morphological stasis and even the Devonian fossils look rather modern. Indeed, most amber fossils are comparable to Recent groups despite a major gap in the fossil record of almost 250 Myr. Baltic amber inclusions indicate palaeofauna inhabiting much warmer climates than today and point to climatic shifts in central Europe since the Eocene. They also indicate that some groups (e.g. Feaellidae and Pseudogarypidae) had much wider Eocene distributions. Their present-day occurrence is relictual and highlights past extinction events. Faunas from younger tropical amber deposits (e.g. Dominican and Mexican amber) are comparable to Recent ones. Generally, there is a strong bias in the amber record towards groups that live under tree bark, whereas those from litter habitats are underrepresented. We also discuss challenges in interpreting fossils: their cryptic morphology warranting novel techniques of morphological reconstruction, the massive gap in the fossil record between the Palaeozoic and Mesozoic, and problems with the classification of (historically) old amber material. Finally, we discuss aspects of the palaeoecology and biology of the fossils compared with the Recent fauna, such as phoresy.","[Harms, Danilo] Univ Hamburg, Ctr Nat Hist, Zool Museum, Martin Luther King Pl 3, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Dunlop, Jason A.] Museum Nat Kunde, Leibniz Inst Evolut & Biodivers Sci, Invalidenstr 43, D-10115 Berlin, Germany","Harms, D (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Ctr Nat Hist, Zool Museum, Martin Luther King Pl 3, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",danilo.harms@uni-hamburg.de,"Dunlop, Jason A./AAC-8042-2019",,,,,134,18,20,0,24,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",2193-0066,1860-1014,,FOSS REC,Foss.

The clypeus, highly modified as in other closely related haidomyrmecine hell ants, is equipped with a paddle-like projection similar to Ceratomyrmex. X-ray imaging reveals that this clypeal paddle is reinforced, most probably with sequestered metals. Presumably this fortified clypeal structure was utilized in tandem with scythe-like mandibles to pin and potentially puncture soft-bodied prey.

Whereas some species resemble nocturnal Ichneumonidae, others might be mistaken for spider wasps or different groups of brachypterous Hymenoptera. Despite their varied morphology, all members of the family supposedly develop as larval ectoparasitoids of crickets (Orthoptera: Grylloidea). Here, we report on the first record of a fossil rhopalosomatid larva which was discovered in mid-Cretaceous amber from northern Myanmar (Burma). The larva is attached to the lateral side of a cricket between the metafemur and the abdomen, impacting the natural position of the hind leg, exactly as documented for modern species. Additionally, the larval gestalt is strikingly similar to those of extant forms. These observations imply that this behavioral specialization, e.g., host association and positioning on host, likely evolved in the stem of the family at least 100 million years ago.","[Lohrmann, Volker] Ubersee Museum Bremen, Bahnhofspl 13, D-28195 Bremen, Germany; [Lohrmann, Volker] Museum Nat Kunde, Leibniz Inst Evolut & Biodiversitatsforsch, Invalidenstr 43, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Engel, Michael S.] Nat Hist Museum, Div Entomol, 1501 Crestline Dr Suite 140, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Engel, Michael S.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 1501 Crestline Dr Suite 140, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Engel, Michael S.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, Cent Pk West & 79th St, New York, NY 10024 USA","Lohrmann, V (corresponding author), Ubersee Museum Bremen, Bahnhofspl 13, D-28195 Bremen, Germany.; Lohrmann, V (corresponding author), Museum Nat Kunde, Leibniz Inst Evolut & Biodiversitatsforsch, Invalidenstr 43, D-10115 Berlin, Germany.",v.lohrmann@uebersee-museum.de,"Lohrmann, Volker/AAB-4489-2020; Engel, Michael S/C-5461-2012","Lohrmann, Volker/0000-0003-0476-7041; Engel, Michael S/0000-0003-3067-077X",,,,36,10,11,0,2,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,GOTTINGEN,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",2193-0066,1860-1014,,FOSS REC,Foss.

The recent studies based on new material, especially from the Cenomanian Burmese amber, shed light on evolutionary history of Acercaria resolving Permopsocida as the stem group of Condylognatha. However, the knowledge of the remaining two orders differs significantly. Results: In this study, we describe new specimens and evaluate morphology of various structures with emphasis on the mouthparts and wing venation. Our results are primary based on revisions of the type specimens with a proper delimitation of taxa Hypoperlida and Miomoptera followed by their significance for the evolutionary history of Acercaria. Three new genera as Belmomantis gen. nov., Elmomantis gen. nov., and Mazonopsocus gen. nov. are designated as members of Palaeomanteidae. The Pennsylvanian Mazonopsocus provides a minimum age for calibration, in accordance to the presence of crown acercarians during the late Carboniferous. Conclusions: This contribution demonstrates that Hypoperlida and Miomoptera are stem groups of Acercaria. The putative clade (Hypoperlida + Miomoptera) is appearing as potential sister group of (Psocodea + (Permopsocida + (Thripida + Hemiptera))).","[Prokop, Jakub; Pecharova, Martina] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, Vinicna 7, Prague 12843 2, Czech Republic; [Garrouste, Romain; Chintauan-Marquier, Ioana C.; Nel, Andre] Sorbonne Univ, UPMC, MNHN,CNRS,Entomol, Inst Systemat Evolut Biodivers ISYEB EPHE UMR 72, 57 Rue Cuvier,CP 50, F-75005 Paris, France; [Beattie, Robert] Australian Museum, 1 William St, Sydney, NSW 2010, Australia","Nel, A (corresponding author), Sorbonne Univ, UPMC, MNHN,CNRS,Entomol, Inst Systemat Evolut Biodivers ISYEB EPHE UMR 72, 57 Rue Cuvier,CP 50, F-75005 Paris, France.",anel@mnhn.fr,"Chintauan-Marquier, Ioana C./F-5830-2013; Prokop, Jakub/B-1432-2008; GARROUSTE, Romain/AAK-3692-2021","Chintauan-Marquier, Ioana C./0000-0002-4066-6902; Prokop, Jakub/0000-0001-6996-7832; GARROUSTE, Romain/0000-0002-0880-5781; Pecharova, Martina/0000-0003-4611-1868","Agency of the Czech RepublicGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [14-03847 J]; ICCM; Agence Nationale de la Recherche under LabExFrench National Research Agency (ANR) [ANR-10-LABX-0003-BCDiv, ANR-11-IDEX-0004-02]","The first author (J.P.) acknowledges the financial support of the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic (No. 14-03847 J).

This is the third known and the best preserved fossil of `lepiceroid' myxophagan beetles, making it possible to carry out a more detailed comparative study than previously published findings. Detailed analyses of diagnostic characters given by previous authors for dagger Haplochelus (dagger Haplochelidae) and tLepichelus (= Lepiceroides) (Lepiceridae) led to conclusions that some features might have been misinterpreted, others do not differ from those in Lepicerus, and the remaining morphological structures can be regarded as variable within one genus. Consequently, Haplochelus and Lepichelus are placed as junior synonyms of Lepicerus, and the synonymy between Haplochelidae and Lepiceridae, previously suggested by other authors, is maintained. Lepicerus mumia, although classified in the extant genus, shows an unusual, presumably ancestral myxophagan character state, a partly divided protarsus, with a distinctly demarcated, enlarged and curved tarsomere 1. The presence of a crust partly covering the body of L. mumia suggests a similar biology as that of two extant species that live near river banks among other semiaquatic arthropods.

Owing to interest in harvestman diversity, evolution and biogeography, their relationships have been thoroughly studied using morphology and PCR-based Sanger approaches to infer their systematic relationships. More recently, two studies utilized transcriptomics-based phylogenomics to explore their basal relationships and diversification, but sampling was limiting for understanding deep evolutionary patterns, as they lacked good taxon representation at the family level. Here, we analysed a set of the 14 existing transcriptomes with 40 additional ones generated for this study, representing approximately 80% of the extant familial diversity in Opiliones. Our phylogenetic analyses, including a set of data matrices with different gene occupancy and evolutionary rates, and using a multitude of methods correcting for a diversity of factors affecting phylogenomic data matrices, provide a robust and stable Opiliones tree of life, where most families and higher taxa are precisely placed. Our dating analyses using alternative calibration points, methods and analytical parameters provide well-resolvedold divergences, consistent with ancient regionalization in Pangea in some groups, and Pangean vicariance in others. The integration of state-of-the-art molecular techniques and analyses, together with the broadest taxonomic sampling to date presented in a phylogenomic study of harvestmen, provide new insights into harvestmen interrelationships, as well as an overview of the general biogeographic patterns of this ancient arthropod group.","[Fernandez, Rosa; Tourinho, Ana Lucia; Giribet, Gonzalo] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Museum Comparat Zool, 26 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Sharma, Prashant P.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Zool, 352 Birge Hall,430 Lincoln Dr, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Tourinho, Ana Lucia] Inst Nacl Pesquisas Amazon, CBIO, Avenida Andre Araujo,2936, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil","Fernandez, R; Giribet, G (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Museum Comparat Zool, 26 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",rfernandezgarcia@g.harvard.edu; ggiribet@g.harvard.edu,"Fernandez, Rosa/AAR-5567-2021; Fernandez, Rosa/Q-2294-2016; Tourinho, Ana Lucia/G-3598-2012; Giribet, Gonzalo/P-1086-2015","Fernandez, Rosa/0000-0002-4719-6640; Fernandez, Rosa/0000-0002-4719-6640; Tourinho, Ana Lucia/0000-0001-8335-328X; Giribet, Gonzalo/0000-0002-5467-8429","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB1457539, DBI-1202751]; National GeographicNational Geographic Society [9043-11]; International Postdoctoral [CNPq 200972/2013-8]; MCZ; CAPES/PVECoordenacao de Aperfeicoamento de Pessoal de Nivel Superior (CAPES) [AUX-PE-PVES 2510/2012]; Division Of Environmental BiologyNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) [1457539] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","The following funding sources were used: NSF grant DEB1457539 (G.G.); National Geographic grant no. 9043-11 (G.G.); International Postdoctoral grant no.

Fossil ticks are very rare. Those from Burmese amber are the oldest examples of Ixodida recorded so far, and this is also the first time that this specific interaction between ticks and spiders has been documented in the fossil record. Spiders occasionally prey on ticks in modern ecosystems. However, those families which have been recorded catching ticks today lack a convincing Mesozoic fossil record and it is difficult to identify the producer of the fossil silk with any certainty. It is also possible that the tick was not part of the spider's usual prey spectrum, but accidentally entered the web and was subjected to immobilization wrapping as an initial precautionary attack.

This is particularly the case for one of the more basal lineages, the superfamily Chthonioidea, which are common and diverse in leaf litter habitats across the world but have only been described in the fossil record from some specimens in Baltic, Dominican and Chiapas ambers. Here, we describe and illustrate the oldest pseudoscorpion of the superfamily Chthonioidea from the mid-Cretaceous (lowermost Cenomanian, ca. 99 Mya) amber of northern Myanmar and extend the known fossil record of this diverse superfamily from the Eocene into the Cretaceous. Fragments that suggest a diverse pseudoscorpion fauna have been recorded in Myanmar (Burmese) amber but this is only the fourth pseudoscorpion fossil described from this ancient amber type. The single adult female specimen is substantially older than the next oldest fossil chthonioids, which were described from Baltic amber (ca. 44-49 Mya), and displays small but significant differences to other chthonioids, such that we describe a new genus and species, Weygoldtiella plausus gen. et sp. nov. The placement of the trichobothria on the chelal hand suggests it can be attributed to the family Chthoniidae, but important morphological features are obscured in the fossil which obfuscates hypotheses regarding its nearest relatives. The specimen, although imperfectly preserved, has no known Recent relatives in this area or elsewhere in the diverse chthonioid fauna, and may represent an extinct lineage. Overall, this fossil is another example of the diverse arachnid community preserved in Burmese amber that includes lineages that are now extinct here and of considerable biogeographic interest, e.g. ricinuleids, and fauna which is essentially modern, e.g. solifuges.

They represent the oldest fossil record of Psephenidae, and show a high similarity in morphology with fossils from the Eocene Messel pit, Germany. The new phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that S. birmaniasis and the Messel specimen can be placed in the subfamily Eubrianacinae. The structure of the gills and functional spiracles indicates that the respiration system of the larvae of S. birmaniasis was well-developed. Specifically, their medial suture is well-developed, which might be a plesiomorphic character. Evolutionary relationships and biogeographical distribution patterns are discussed, the evidence supports a general dispersal trend from Southeast Asia to Europe. Furthermore, S. birmaniasis provides new insights into the taphonomy of similar organisms, in this process a huge amount of resin and fast embedding of specimens are important factors.

It belongs to the extant Pelecotominae and represents the second documented occurrence of this subfamily in the Late Cretaceous. This new taxon is morphologically distinguishable in Pelecotominae by the combination of following characters: eyes oval, without incision; antennomeres V-X serrate, with XI fusiform; maxillary palpi unmodified; protarsi shorter than protibiae; tibiae sparsely provided with spines; tibial spurs formula 2-0-2. Together with other previously reported fossil ripiphorids, it highlights the species diversification of wedge-shaped beetles during their early evolution. On the other hand, a morphological similarity between Spinotoma and modern pelecotomines and the occurrence of xylophagous beetles in the Burmese amber suggest a similar host preference in wood-boring beetles for this species, shedding lights on an ancient host-parasitoid relationship in the late Mesozoic. This paper also provides a brief discussion on the taxonomy and evolution of Mesozoic wedge-shaped beetles. The wedged-shaped body form and fully-developed elytra in Recent Pelecotominae and Ptilophorinae are considered to be derived from their early ancestors rather than evolved with the onset of flowering plants during the Cretaceous as commonly thought.

Isolitaphis prolatantennus Poinar, 2017 (Isolitaphidae) from the same deposit was also included in this phylogenetic analysis due to the similarities between two families. Two main Glades within Juraphididae are recognized from our cladistic analysis: Prolavexillaphis Liu, Yao and Qiao gen. nov. and Isolitaphis (Poinar, 2017) form a monophyletic lineage; Aphaorus (Wegierek, 1991), Pterotella (Wegierek, 1991), Juraphis (Shaposhnikov, 1979) form a monophyletic lineage.

Tribal placement as regards fossil oxyteline taxa is discussed.","[Makranczy, Gyorgy] Hungarian Nat Hist Museum, Dept Zool, Baross Utca 13, H-1088 Budapest, Hungary; [Yamamoto, Shuhei] Field Museum Nat Hist, Integrat Res Ctr, 1400 S Lake Shore Dr, Chicago, IL 60605 USA; [Engel, Michael S.] Univ Kansas, Nat Hist Museum, Div Entomol, 1501 Crestline Dr,Suite 140, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Engel, Michael S.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 1501 Crestline Dr,Suite 140, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Engel, Michael S.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, Cent Pk West 79th St, New York, NY 10024 USA","Makranczy, G (corresponding author), Hungarian Nat Hist Museum, Dept Zool, Baross Utca 13, H-1088 Budapest, Hungary.",makranczy.gyorgy@nhmus.hu,"Engel, Michael S/C-5461-2012; Yamamoto, Shuhei/U-8247-2018","Engel, Michael S/0000-0003-3067-077X; Yamamoto, Shuhei/0000-0002-4162-8457","Field Museum; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (Tokyo, Japan) Overseas Research FellowshipMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [29-212]","We are grateful to Al Newton (Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago) for providing an initial set of notes and comments on the specimen, and to Aslak Kappel Hansen and Janina Lisa Kypke (University of Copenhagen, Denmark) who aided the first two authors with taking photographs and experience with photographing amber specimens.

A new species belonging to the extant genus Sarothrias Grouvelle, dagger Sarothrias cretaceus sp. nov., is preserved in the Upper Cretaceous amber from Myanmar, representing the first fossil Jacobsoniidae from the Mesozoic. Sarothrias cretaceus is most similar to the Recent species S. audax lipiski & Lobl from the Tanimbar Islands of East Indonesia, differing from it by the presence of elytral costae bearing squamiform setae, but it appears to retain several ancestral features, including the three-segmented club, non-setose and afoveate abdominal ventrite 1, and well-developed discrimen on the metaventrite. The new discovery indicates antiquity of the genus Sarothrias and the family Jacobsoniidae, suggesting that the family probably originated before the breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, consistent with the hypothesis that the crown-group Staphylinoidea (including Jacobsoniidae) appeared about 193 million years ago. The regional distribution of the modern and fossil Sarothrias is indicative of biogeographical stasis, whereby dispersal was limited from the region of origin of the stem group.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:93C41362-D78B-4C26-9132-0D56030FB18C","[Cai, Chenyang] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, Key Lab Econ Stratig & Palaeogeog, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Slipinski, Adam] CSIRO, Australian Natl Insect Collect, GPO Box 1700, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Leschen, Richard A.

Furthermore, distinctive morphological characters of C. patrickmuelleri with significant phylogenetic relevance are discussed. The general morphology, particularly that of the larva, has changed little between the Mesozoic and Cenozoic, and it reflects an evolutionary stasis that might correspond to their aquatic larval life-style.

Paracoryphagrionidae is attributed to the clade Pseudostigmatoidea, due to the presence of an extremely long, less zigzagged vein CuA covering numerous cells, reaching the pterostigmal level, and being parallel with the hindwing margin; plus numerous trigonal cells, all shared with Coryphagrion grandis Morton, 1924 of this clade. Paracoryphagrionidae differ from other pseudostigmatoid families in the absence of the kink of RP1 at the pterostigmal brace, a very long sclerotized pterostigma, only one row of cells in the poststigmal area between the costal margin and RA, and no sigmoidally curved RA and RP1 at the wing apex. Paracoryphagrion deltoides is unique within Zygoptera due to the presence of a very elongate pterostigma and many triangular cells in the postsubnodal area. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

They are similar in form to Teredolites clavatus Leymerie, 1842 and Gastrochaenolites lapidicus Kelly & Bromley, 1984; however, the former identification is preferable, given that they are martesiine crypts in amber as opposed to a lithic substrate. Cross-cutting relationships between the clavate features and inclusions in the amber demonstrate that the features post-date hardening of the resin. The fills of the crypts are variable, including sand grade sediment of very fine to coarse sand grainsize, and sparry calcite cements. In some cases, the articulated valves of the pholadid bivalve responsible are visible inside the borings. However, one remarkable specimen contains two pairs of articulated shells 'floating' in amber, not associated with crypts; an observation that suggests that the resin was still liquid or soft when the bivalves were trapped in the resin. One individual is associated with an irregular sediment-filled feature and shows shell breakage. Formation of a solid rim around a liquid central volume has been documented in subaqueous bodies of resin in modern swamp forests, and argues for a close proximity between the amber-producing trees and a brackish water habitat for the bivalves. The presence of pyrite as thin films and crystal groups within Burmese amber is further consistent with such a depositional environment. Comparison of the size of pholadid body fossils with growth rates of modern equivalents allows the duration of boring activities to be estimated and suggests that small fossil pholadids in Burmese amber became trapped and died within 1-2 weeks of having settled on the resin. Larger examples present within well-formed domichnia formed in hardened resin. Since 'hardground' describes early lithified sediment as a substrate and 'woodground' describes wood as a substrate, the term 'amberground' is used here to described borings in an amber substrate.","[Smith, Ru D.

We report here the first Mesozoic stick insect, Elasmophasma stictum gen. et sp. nov., with well-preserved, thin, lateral lamellae on the thoracic pleura, the terga of abdominal segments I-X and the ventrolateral margins of all femora. This new species, from the mid-Cretaceous amber of northern Myanmar, has a clear, stick-like body and is assigned to Euphasmatodea. The abdominal structures of E. stictum exhibit traces of multiple expansions of the terga, suggesting that such structure might have been an early development of body expansions used to improve crypsis for stick or leaf insects when they sprawled on twigs or leaves.","[Chen, Sha; Lin, Xiaodan; Shih, Chungkun; Gao, Taiping; Ren, Dong] Capital Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, 105 Xisanhuanbeilu, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China; [Yin, Xiangchu] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Plateau Biol, 23 Xinning Rd, Xining 810008, Qinghai, Peoples R China; [Shih, Chungkun] Smithsonian Inst, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Dept Paleobiol, Washington, DC 20013 USA; [Zhang, Runzhi] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, State Key Lab Integrated Management Pest Insects, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Gao, TP; Ren, D (corresponding author), Capital Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, 105 Xisanhuanbeilu, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China.",tpgao@cnu.edu.cn; rendong@mail.cnu.edu.cn,"Gao, Taiping/Z-3987-2019","Ren, Dong/0000-0001-8660-0901; Gao, Taiping/0000-0002-8118-8708","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31730087, 41688103, 31672323]; Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in UniversityProgram for Changjiang Scholars & Innovative Research Team in University (PCSIRT) [IRT-17R75]; Support Project of High-level Teachers in Beijing Municipal Universities in the Period of 13th Five-year Plan [IDHT20180518, CITTCD201704090]; Young Elite Scientist Sponsorship Program by CAST (YESS); Beijing Natural Science FoundationBeijing Natural Science Foundation [5182004]","D.R. was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant nos. 31730087, 41688103 and 31672323), the Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University (IRT-17R75) and Support Project of High-level Teachers in Beijing Municipal Universities in the Period of 13th Five-year Plan (grant no.

Recent explorations of Mesozoic scydmaenine fauna in Burmese, Canadian, French, and Spanish ambers have shed intriguing light on the early evolution, systematics, and particular aspects of predator-prey relationship among this group. However, in contrast to extant diversity, well-preserved fossils allowing for sufficient morphological studies and ecological reconstructions are extremely rare. Here we report a highly advanced glandulariine scydmaenine, Nuegua elongata Yin, Cai & Newton, gen. et sp. nov., based on a large series of fifteen exquisitely preserved specimens entombed in mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber. The new genus strikingly displays an extremely prolonged preocular region that accounts for over half of the head length-a structure unknown among all known living and extinct scydmaenines, but analogous to that of certain groups of the modern Laemophloeidae, Curculionoidea, Salpingidae, and Staphylinidae. We provide a formal description of the new genus, compare it with the most probably related taxa, and discuss possible functions of this bizarre head elongation. The discovery highlights the morphological disparity and palaeodiversity of the subfamily Scydmaeninae in late Mesozoic. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Pselaphinae is split basally into two principal clades: the small supertribe Faronitae, and its sister group, the hyper-diverse higher Pselaphinae' containing the remaining five supertribes. Deducing the origins and divergence times of major higher Pselaphinae clades requires direct fossil evidence. Here we describe a new pselaphine rove beetle, Cretobythus excavatus Yin, Parker & Cai gen. et sp. nov., based on a well-preserved individual embedded in mid-Cretaceous amber from Myanmar (Cenomanian, c. 99 Ma). Cretobythus does not obviously belong to any Recent tribe, but Bayesian phylogenetic placement using morphological characters supports a position within the stem-group of the tribe Bythinini, sister to Boreotethys Parker, a genus also recently described from Burmese amber. Together, Cretobythus + Boreotethys comprise the sister group of modern Bythinini. Despite some external similarities to Recent Bythinini, Cretobythus exhibits several plesiomorphic traits, including a generally flattened body plan, and metacoxae that are positioned close to the ventral midline. The resemblance in form of the enlarged maxillary palpi of Cretobythus to extant bythinines implies a similar function in prey capture, indicating that the unusual employment of the maxillary palps to trap moving prey in Bythinini had probably evolved by the mid-Cretaceous, at the latest.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:9FEB523F-76A7-4502-AF02-FCC0FAAB262A","[Yin, Zi-Wei; Li, Li-Zhen] Shanghai Normal Univ, Dept Biol, 100 Guilin Rd, Shanghai 200234, Peoples R China; [Parker, Joseph] Columbia Univ, Dept Genet & Dev, New York, NY USA; [Parker, Joseph] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Cai, Chen-Yang] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, Key Lab Econ Stratig & Palaeogeog, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Huang, Di-Ying] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Cai, CY (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, Key Lab Econ Stratig & Palaeogeog, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",cycai@nigpas.ac.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31501874, 41602009, 91514302]; Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai MunicipalityScience & Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality (STCSM) [15YF1408700]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB18030501]; Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu ProvinceNatural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province [BK20161091]","Alfred F.

Many inclusions of different taxa in several insect orders have been well analysed, but this is the first study focussed on the Thysanoptera found in Burmite. In the sub-order Terebrantia, family Merothripidae, Myanmarothrips pankowskiorum gen. n., sp. n. is recognized in various amber samples from a total of 34 females but only one male. In the sub-order Tubulifera, Rohrthrips burmiticus sp. n. is based on a single female with a tubular tenth abdominal segment. This is an exceptionally well-preserved specimen, and details of the mouth parts indicate that the gnathal apparatus of modern Tubulifera was already developed in the Cretaceous. Due to plesiomorphic characters with respect to extant Tubulifera, the genus Rohrthrips is transferred to Rohrthripidae fam. n., and this family is clearly differentiated from extant Phlaeothripidae.","[Ulitzka, Manfred R.] Thrips ID, Strassburger Str 37A, D-77652 Offenburg, Germany","Ulitzka, MR (corresponding author), Thrips ID, Strassburger Str 37A, D-77652 Offenburg, Germany.",manfred.ulitzka@thysanoptera.de,,,,,,37,7,8,0,6,MAGNOLIA PRESS,AUCKLAND,"PO BOX 41383, AUCKLAND, ST LUKES 1030, NEW ZEALAND",1175-5326,1175-5334,,ZOOTAXA,Zootaxa,Oct-01,2018,4486,4,,,,,548,558,,10.11646/zootaxa.4486.4.8,,,11,Zoology,Zoology,GV2LS,WOS:000445921700007,30313740,Bronze,,,20/07/2021

Marine macroscopic inclusions are also very rare and were recently described from Cretaceous Burmese amber and Early Miocene Mexican amber. Whereas a coastal setting for the amber source forests is generally proposed, different scenarios have been suggested to explain how these marine inclusions can become trapped in a resin of terrestrial origin. These scenarios include an introduction of marine organisms (i) through high tides, (ii) from storms and resulting in flooding of the littoral/estuarine forest floor, (iii) in resin dropped into the sea in mangrove-type settings, or (iv) by wind and sea spray. We investigated the possibility of a wind-driven introduction of marine microorganisms into tree resins using modern coastal conifer forests with the highly resinous Cook pine (Araucaria columnaris) in New Caledonia as a model for the Cretaceous amber forests from France. By exposing fresh resin surfaces on the seaward side of the trees and the collection of older in situ resins, we confirmed that marine microorganisms can become trapped on sea-exposed resin, along with remnants from terrestrial organisms, and salt crystals. We suggest that, for cases where only a few marine inclusions are discovered in an amber deposit, an origin from aeolian background deposition is feasible. However, a more energetic but possibly still aeolian event is likely needed to explain the high numbers of marine microorganisms embedded in pieces of Cretaceous amber from France.","[Schmidt, Alexander R.; Grabow, Dennis; Beimforde, Christina; Thiel, Volker; Seyfullah, Leyla J.] Univ Gottingen, Dept Geobiol, Gottingen, Germany; [Perrichot, Vincent] Univ Rennes, CNRS, Geosci Rennes UMR 6118, Rennes, France; [Rikkinen, Jouko] Univ Helsinki, Finnish Museum Nat Hist, Helsinki, Finland; [Rikkinen, Jouko] Univ Helsinki, Fac Biol & Environm Sci, Helsinki, Finland; [Saint Martin, Simona] Museum Natl Hist Nat, Dept Origines & Evolut, UMR MNHN CNRS SU CR2P 7207, Paris, France","Schmidt, AR; Seyfullah, LJ (corresponding author), Univ Gottingen, Dept Geobiol, Gottingen, Germany.",alexander.schmidt@geo.uni-goettingen.de; leyla.seyfullah@geo.uni-goettingen.de,"Perrichot, Vincent/I-4134-2019; Rikkinen, Jouko/AAM-8732-2021","Perrichot, Vincent/0000-0002-7973-0430; Thiel, Volker/0000-0003-4758-2784; Seyfullah, Leyla/0000-0002-0199-9923; Rikkinen, Jouko/0000-0002-4615-6639",OSUR (Univ.

Amberocula gen. nov., is the third genus of Ripidiini documented from the Upper Cretaceous (lowermost Cenomanian) amber of northern Myanmar. Three species are included in the genus: Amberocula muelleri sp. nov. (type species), A. costata sp. nov., and A. fallax sp. nov. Amberocula is represented by six single male inclusions and one quadruple male syninclusion (for A. muelleri). The genus is distinguishable by the combination of number and shape of antennomeres and tarsomeres, reduced mouthparts, and shape of the head, compound eyes, and thorax relative to all extant and fossil members of the tribe Ripidiini. In addition, three single male inclusions and one syninclusion of six males indistinguishable from Paleoripiphorus deploegi Perrichot, Nel, and Neraudeau (Ripidiini) are reported. Described syninclusions of both genera support the previous assumption of aggregative-like behavior of male Ripidiini may be a groundplan feature of the tribe and responsible for the presence of such syninclusions. Two monotypic genera, Plesiotoma alissae gen. et sp. nov. and Burmitoma nalae gen. et sp. nov., are representative of the subfamily Pelecotominae and are also described and figured. The inclusions represent the second and third definitive records for the subfamily in Cretaceous amber, and also the discovery of fossil pelecotomine females. They differ from the contemporaneous Flabellotoma Batelka, Prokop and Engel in the presence of more complete tibial spur formulas and the absence of a ventral abdominal microsclerite. The presence of three species of Amberocula, additional material of P. deploegi, and two new genera of Pelecotominae demonstrates a surprising abundance of ripiphorids in Cretaceous amber, and we provide comments on the past diversity of this parasitoid family during the period, as well as observations on the nature of their preservation and paleoethology. The known diversity of Mesozoic Tenebrionoidea is cataloged and a key to the Cretaceous diversity of Ripiphoridae is presented. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Morphological characters used in the identification of fossil genera and species are identical to those used in studies of extant Ceratopogonidae and, as a result, their potential indicative value is reliable. Two relictual extant genera, Leptoconops and Austroconops, reported from Lower Cretaceous Lebanese amber, are at least 125 million years old. Certain ceratopogonid genera are indicative for the Lower Cretaceous, Upper Cretaceous, Eocene or Miocene. A morphological character indicative for the Upper Cretaceous and Cenozoic is macrotrichia on the wing membrane of adults. Indicator species and genera are reviewed for all amber deposits. Eocene Baltic amber contains the best known fauna of biting midges, with 109 named species. Some genera are indicative of aquatic and semiaquatic habitats (predaceous genera, subfamily Ceratopogoninae), forests with rotting trees (Forcipomyia), sandy sea shore habitats (Leptoconops), a cold boreal climate (Ceratopogon) or warm climates (Nannohelea, Austroconops, Leptoconops, Meunierohelea, Metahelea). Females require a protein-rich meal and are well known for feeding on the blood of vertebrates, but many feed on other things, so this information can help with the interpretation of palaeoenvironments.

While adult mantis lacewings are hence active wait-and-catch predators, the larvae of many mantis lacewings have a quite different biology: first-stage larvae seek out female spiders, mount them, and either wait until the spider has produced an egg sac or, in some cases, choose a female already bearing an egg sac. The larva then enters the egg sac and feeds on the eggs. While first stage larvae are highly mobile with comparably long legs and a certain degree of dorso-ventral flattening (campodeiform), larval stages two and three are almost immobile, grub-like, and simply remain within the egg sac. Fossils of mantis lacewings are relatively rare, fossils of larval mantis lacewings are even rarer; only a single larva sitting on a juvenile spider has been described from ca. 50 million year old Baltic amber.ResultsHere we describe a second occurrence of a larval mantis lacewing from significantly older Burmese amber, about 100 million years old. The specimen is preserved in a position right at the leg of a spider, similar to modern-day larvae that are about to mount their prospective host. The claws of the larva can be seen to grab around the leg of the spider.ConclusionsWe discuss how reliable these fossils are as indicators of palaeo-parasitism, and in which aspects the behaviour of mantis lacewing larvae in general indeed represents parasitism. While the specimen appears to be about to board the spider, it may not necessarily represent a parasite in the strict sense. Evaluating the actual ecological role of a fossil heavily depends on comparison to modern forms, and not all modern-day larvae of Mantispidae are parasites. We therefore provide a closer look into the known feeding habits of modern mantis lacewing larvae.","[Haug, Joachim T.; Haug, Carolin] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Bioctr, Grosshaderner Str 2, Planegg Martinsried, Germany; [Haug, Joachim T.; Haug, Carolin] LMU, GeoBio Ctr, Richard Wagner Str 10, D-80333 Munich, Germany","Haug, JT (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Bioctr, Grosshaderner Str 2, Planegg Martinsried, Germany.; Haug, JT (corresponding author), LMU, GeoBio Ctr, Richard Wagner Str 10, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",joachim.haug@palaeo-evo-devo.info,,,Volkswagen FoundationVolkswagen,The Volkswagen Foundation supports JTH with a Lichtenberg professorship.,,26,20,23,0,4,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2056-306X,,,ZOOL LETT,Zool.

The fossil undoubtedly belongs to the genus Pimeliaphilus, regarded as the earliest-derivative genus in the family.

Although new techniques based on molecular clock methods are already available, tick fossil record still stands as a valuable source of information if correctly interpreted. Here we report about a male specimen of Ornithodoros (Alectorobius) sp. found in Dominican amber of about 25 millions years, illustrating its main morphological features. We also discuss the findings in a recent paper, which may contain unreliable interpretations on some fossil ticks. We support previous data on the presence of Argasidae in Miocene Dominican amber, and provide comments on the presence of ticks in Burmese amber. We further elaborate on the spread of ticks in the light of the record and description of a new family found in Cretaceous amber.","[Estrada-Pena, Agustin] Univ Zaragoza, Dept Anim Pathol, Fac Vet Med, Miguel Servet 177, Zaragoza 50013, Spain; [de la Fuente, Jose] Inst Invest Recursos Cineget IREC CSIC UCLM JCCM, SaBio, Ciudad Real 13005, Spain; [de la Fuente, Jose] Oklahoma State Univ, Dept Vet Pathobiol, Ctr Vet Hlth Sci, Stillwater, OK 74078 USA","Estrada-Pena, A (corresponding author), Univ Zaragoza, Dept Anim Pathol, Fac Vet Med, Miguel Servet 177, Zaragoza 50013, Spain.",aestrada@unizar.es,,"Estrada Pena, Agustin/0000-0001-7483-046X",,,,15,6,6,0,9,SPRINGER,DORDRECHT,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",0168-8162,1572-9702,,EXP APPL ACAROL,Exp.

The new genus resembles some modern Afrotropical and Indomalayan idiocerine genera but differs in having the gena relatively narrow. Archipedionis obscurus gen. and sp. n., is the first well-preserved fossil representative of Macropsini to be described in detail. Previous reports of this tribe from Baltic amber, while credible, included too little morphological information to assess their relationships. Additional comparative notes are provided for previously described fossil taxa belonging to Idiocerini and Macropsini from the Oligocene of Germany.

The nodules are small (less than 10 mm in length), nearly 10,000 of which were screened, yielding several inclusions of fungi and plant fragments, but mostly terrestrial arthropods: 29 specimens in 10 orders and 13 families. The fungi include resinicolous hyphae and a dark, multiseptate hyphomycete. Plants include wood/bark fragments and fibers, and the microphylls of a bryophyte (probably a moss, Musci). Among the arthropods are arachnids: mites (Acari: Oribatida), Pseudoscorpionida, and the bodies and a silken cocoon of spiders (Araneae). Insecta include Blattodea, Thysanoptera, Hemiptera (Heteroptera and Aphidoidea), Coleoptera (Dermestidae: Megatominae), Trichoptera, Diptera (Chironomidae: Tanypodinae), and Hymenoptera (Formicidae: Formicinae). Nymphal aphids predominate (65% of the arthropod individuals), which were probably feeding on the source tree, likely Metasequoia. There is a bias in preservation toward small arthropods (mean body length 0.75 mm) that are surface-dwelling (nonwinged) stages and taxa. Chickaloon amber contains the most northerly fossil records of pseudoscorpions, thrips, Dermestidae, and Cenozoic ants and mites, so the deposit is contributing unique data on high-latitude paleodiversity of the Paleogene hothouse earth.","[Grimaldi, David A.; Nascimbene, Paul C.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Sunderlin, David; Aaroe, Georgene A.; Dempsky, Michelle R.; Parker, Nancy E.; Tillery, George Q.; White, Jaclyn G.] Lafayette Coll, Dept Geol & Environm Geosci, Easton, PA 18042 USA; [Barden, Phillip] New Jersey Inst Technol, Dept Biol, Newark, NJ 07102 USA; [Williams, Christopher J.] Franklin & Marshall Coll, Dept Earth & Environm, Lancaster, PA 17604 USA","Grimaldi, DA (corresponding author), Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, New York, NY 10024 USA.",,"Williams, Christopher/AAX-6843-2020",,"Keck Geology Consortium [NSF-REU 0648782, NSF-REU1062720]; National Geographic Society Committee for Research and Exploration GrantNational Geographic Society [9109-12]; Lafayette College; Franklin & Marshall College","D.S. and C.J.W. are grateful for generous funding through the Keck Geology Consortium (NSF-REU 0648782 and NSF-REU1062720), and the National Geographic Society Committee for Research and Exploration Grant #9109-12, Lafayette College and Franklin & Marshall College.

Sucinorhagonycha samsockorum has a few antennomeres that are slightly dentate, making the new species appear intermediate between genus Sucinorhagonycha Kuska, 1996, with filiform antennae, and genus Cacomorphocerus Schaufuss, 1892, which has saucer-shaped central antennomeres. This suggests that the relationship between the two genera may be closer than previously believed. Malthodes josephi is noteworthy because it has cuticular vesicles extruding from its abdominal segments that suggest their use for chemical defense.

Although the phylogenetic relationships of the extant lineages have been well investigated, the monophyly of Gymnusini has been questioned due to a series of previous studies and the recent discovery of the aleocharine dagger Cretodeinopsis Cai & Huang (Deinopsini) from mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber. Using an additional specimen of dagger Cretodeinopsis and well-preserved specimens of dagger Electrogymnusa Wolf-Schwenninger from Eocene Baltic amber, we present here two types of morphology-based phylogenetic analyses, employing all extant/extinct genera of Gymnusini and Deinopsini for the first time.

Little information is available regarding the origin of scansoriality, which subsequently became widespread and diverse in terms of ecomorphology in this (lade. An undescribed amber fossil (MCZ R-190835) from mid Cretaceous outcrops of the north of Myanmar dated at 99 Ma, previously assigned to stem Gekkota, preserves carpal, metacarpal and phalangeal bones, as well as supplementary climbing structures, such as adhesive pads and paraphalangeal elements. This fossil documents the presence of highly specialized adaptive structures. Here, we analyze in detail the manus of the putative stem Gekkota. We use morphological comparisons in the context of extant squamates, to produce a detailed descriptive analysis and a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) based on 32 skeletal variables of the manus. The comparative sample includes members of 15 extant squamate families (Agamidae, Dactyloidae, lguanidae, Leiosauridae, Liolaemidae, Polychrotidae, Tropiduridae, Diplodactylidae, Eublepharidae, Gekkonidae, Phyllodactylidae, Sphaerodactylidae, Gymnophthalmidae, Teiidae, and Scincidae). Although the fossil manus is qualitatively more similar to that of members of Gekkota, the LDA analysis places it in a morphozone shared by Gekkota and Scincomorpha. This result is particularly interesting, given that despite the presence of paraphalangeal structures had only been reported in extant geckos of the families Gekkonidae and Phyllodactylidae, the usage of an adhesive subdigital system to climb originated independently in Gekkota, Scincidae, and Dactyloidae.

Details of their origins remain obscure, with little knowledge of their stem group and few insights into the sequence of character acquisition during spider evolution. Here, we describe Chimerarachne yingi gen. et sp. nov., a remarkable arachnid from the mid-Cretaceous (approximately 100 million years ago) Burmese amber of Myanmar, which documents a key transition stage in spider evolution. Like uraraneids, the two fossils available retain a segmented opisthosoma bearing a whip-like telson, but also preserve two traditional synapomorphies for Araneae: a male pedipalp modified for sperm transfer and well-defined spinnerets resembling those of modern mesothele spiders. This unique character combination resolves C. yingi within a Glade including both Araneae and Uraraneida; however, its exact position relative to these orders is sensitive to different parameters of our phylogenetic analysis. Our new fossil most likely represents the earliest branch of the Araneae, and implies that there was a lineage of tailed spiders that presumably originated in the Palaeozoic and survived at least into the Cretaceous of Southeast Asia.","[Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Dunlop, Jason A.] Humboldt Univ, Leibniz Inst Res Evolut & Biodivers, Museum Nat Unde, Berlin, Germany; [Selden, Paul A.] Univ Kansas, Dept Geol, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Selden, Paul A.; Garwood, Russell J.] Nat Hist Museum, Earth Sci Dept, London, England; [Garwood, Russell J.] Univ Manchester, Sch Earth & Environm Sci, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Shear, William A.] Hampden Sydney Coll, Dept Biol, Hampden Sydney, VA 23943 USA; [Mueller, Patrick] Friedhofstr 9, Kashofen, Germany; [Lei, Xiaojie] Univ Sci & Technol China, Hefei, Anhui, Peoples R China","Wang, B (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Wang, B (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, Beijing, Peoples R China.",bowang@nigpas.ac.cn,"Selden, Paul/C-7530-2009; Dunlop, Jason A./AAC-8042-2019","Selden, Paul/0000-0001-7454-4260; ","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41572010, 41622201, 41688103]; Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDPB05]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [2011224]","We are grateful to M.

NOV.; GLANDULARIINI; CEPHENNIITAE; PHYLOGENY; MYANMAR,"The tribe Scydmaenini represents one of the most successful modern groups of the ant-like stone beetles (Scydmaeninae), displaying a high degree of species diversity (>750 species) and morphological disparity. Surprisingly, direct fossil evidence crucial for elucidating the origin and early evolution of Scydmaenini is lacking. This gap of knowledge is of particular interest as the Cretaceous origin of other major scydmaenine lineages, e.g., Mastigini, Eutheiini, Cephenniini, and Clandulariini, were recently documented. Here, we report a new genus and species, Kuaju borealis gen. et sp. nov., from Cretaceous Burmese amber, pushing back the oldest definitive record of stem-group Scydmaenini to approximately 99 Ma. An affinity of the new taxon with recent Scydmaenini is strongly supported by the beetle's short, dome-like terminal (fourth) maxillary palpomeres, as well as an exposed metanepimera which are typical character states of the tribe. However, Kuafu possesses a plesiomorphic un-notched anterior margin of the scape, a character state unknown among living Scydmaenini, and suggesting a basal position of the fossil taxon. Our find provides firm evidence that stem-group Scydmaenini, like other major scydmaenine lineages, originated no later than the mid-Cretaceous, removing the possibility that Scydmaenini may had a young, Quaternary origin.

Two other species are placed in the same genus, but they remain unnamed. This is the first known extinct genus of the large tribe Cephenniini that includes cosmopolitan extant ant-like stone beetles with uniquely modified mouthparts adapted to feed on armored mites. dagger Praphennium shares most exoskeletal characters with its extant relatives, and the structure and position of its hypognathous head suggest that the adults were also specialized predators that fed on heavily sclerotized oribatid or uropodine mites. One of the studied specimens seems to be teratological, with a reduced number of antennomeres, representing the first such a case in the fossil record of Scydmaeninae. Together with a previously known Turonian dagger Hyperstenichnus of Glandulariini, the discovery of dagger Praphennium supports early origins of acarophagy among Scydmaeninae, the only group of beetles that have adapted to feeding on this well-protected group of soil arthropods. A preliminary phylogenetic analysis suggests a close relationship between dagger Praphennium and the extant genera Cephennodes and Hlavaciellus, and this Glade might have likely evolved within the Eurasian part of Laurasia.

Inclusions in Taimyr amber (84-100 Ma) assigned to Baeomorpha are reviewed and the following eleven new species, all of Gumovsky, are described: B. avamica sp. nov., B. baikurenis sp. nov., B. bianellus sp. nov., B. caeleps sp. nov., B. gracilis sp. nov., B. ingens sp. nov., B. quattorduo sp. nov., B. quattoruno sp. nov., B. popovi sp. nov., B. yanfardakh sp. nov., and B. zherikhini sp. nov. The recognized species are differentiated in separate keys to females and males and illustrated through microphotography. Two of four previously described Baeomorpha species from Campanian Canadian amber are synonymized: B. distincta Yoshimoto and B. elongata Yoshimoto under B. ovatata Yoshimoto (syn. nov.). One enigmatic rotoitid inclusion, which differs from Baeomorpha species in the possession of very short stigmal vein, is described as Taimyromorpha pusilla Gumovsky gen. et sp. nov. inclusions containing specimens identified as Baeomorpha and Taimyromorpha are found in amber from Taimyr and Canada that originated from Laurasia, not Gondwana. Two Realms are newly proposed to recognize different Cretaceous faunal elements, a more northern Baeomorpha Realm that is characterized by a temperate or warm temperate climate and very abundant aphid fossils, and the Isoptera Realm, an opposing southward territory with a warmer climate and common termite but rare aphid fossils. The newly described fossils indicate the southern hemisphere distribution of extant Rotoitidae is relictual with the pattern observed being formed at least in part by extinction events, though distributions of the only two extant rotoitid genera, Rotoita Boutek and Noyes, 1987 (New Zealand) and Chiloe Gibson and Huber, 2000 (small area in the southern Chile) may have been more extensive in the past. Both of known regions of extant Rotoitidae have highly suppressed ant faunas, which may suggest that their survival there depended on low biocenotic pressure by ants, perhaps as low as is hypothesized for the Late Cretaceous. The Canadian amber genera Distylopus Yoshimoto, 1975 (Distylopinae) and Bouceklytus Yoshimoto, 1975 (Bouceklytinae) are excluded from Tetracampidae and regarded as Chalcidoidea incertae sedis.

Here I assemble measurements of over 260 published mite fossils, distributed from the Early Devonian (410 mya) to the end of the Neogene (5 mya), and compare them to the data available for their extant relatives. A number of fossils are reconsidered: reports of the Ordovician Brachypylina and Permian Astigmata have to be excluded from the fossil record; Jurassic fossils of Trhypochthoniidae (Nothrina) are reconsidered as Neoliodidae (Brachypylina) and Desmonomata (Brachypylina or Nothrina). Based on these data, mites began small. From the oldest, Paleozoic, fossils through the Jurassic, Sarcoptiformes show a positive size trend, which then ceases. The smallest mites, are recovered from the Triassic amber. Cretaceous amber fossils show wide size range, which further increases through the Cenozoic. Fossils of mites tend to fall within size ranges of their extant relatives mostly on the smaller side of those ranges. Paleozoic fossils, however, tend to be on the larger side of their relatives' size range. What can be called a Jurassic anomaly - a set of much larger-than-extant fossils currently attributed to Cymbaeremaeidae - calls for further study.","[Sidorchuk, Ekaterina A.] Russian Acad Sci, Paleontol Inst, Moscow, Russia; [Sidorchuk, Ekaterina A.] Tyumen State Univ, Int Integrated Res Lab Climate Change Land Use &, Tyumen, Russia","Sidorchuk, EA (corresponding author), Russian Acad Sci, Paleontol Inst, Moscow, Russia.",e.a.sidorchuk@gmail.com,,"Sidorchuk, Ekaterina/0000-0002-2009-5276",,,,93,10,13,1,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0164-7954,1945-3892,,INT J ACAROL,Int.

A further comparison between Nilionympha and other gumilline genera is provided to corroborate the generic status according to the updated diagnostic characters of forewing. The species Nilionympha imperfecta Ren and Engel, 2007 is transferred to the genus of Enodinympha. Gumillinae, a particular subfamily within Osmylidae, are characterized by the long antennae and absence of ocelli. The only extant genus Gumilla is restricted in South America (Navas, 1912, Martins et al., 2016). However, the hitherto diverse and widely distributed gumilline fossils represent nine worldwide genera (Winterton et al., 2017) with only one fossil genus of Nuddsia in the Southern Hemisphere from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil (Menon & Makarkin, 2008, Martins-Neto & Rodrigues, 2010). The other genera are widely distributed in the northern regions. Two other Cretaceous genera have been recorded respectively from southern England (Osmylochrysa) and Myanmar (Burmese) amber (Burmaleon) (Jepson et al., 2012, Myskowiak et al., 2016). The diversity of the Jurassic gumillines was broader with six genera hitherto. The genus Epiosmylus was firstly documented in the Late Jurassic of Karatau (Panfilov, 1980), and subsequently, two species were described respectively from the Middle Jurassic of Daohugou, China and West Siberian Kubekovo, Russia (Ren & Yin, 2002, Khramov, 2017). In addition, Khramov (2014) described another genus Kolbasinella from the Karatau locality (Khramov, 2014). The Daohugou locality is well-known for the well-preserved and diverse insect fossils (Ren et al., 2010, Wang et al., 2010, 2012, Gao et al., 2012, Gu et al., 2012, Yao et al., 2014, Wang et al., 2016). It has hitherto yielded five gumilline genera, i.e. Epiosmylus, Enodinympha, Nilionympha, Tenuosmylus and Allotriosmylus (Ren & Yin, 2002, Ren & Engel, 2007, Wang et al., 2009, Yang et al., 2010). Among them, the genus Nilionympha was not well-documented due to the absence of forewing information when it was established (Ren & Engel, 2007). Herein we reexamined the type specimens referring to the Nilionympha species and emended the generic diagnosis by incorporating the forewing information. We describe a new species Nilionympha shantouensis sp. nov. from the Middle Jurassic Jiulongshan Formation of Daohugou, Inner Mongolia, China. Based on the analysis of forewing, we deem that the species N. imperfecta should be transferred to Enodinympha.","[Li, Qinghua; Ren, Dong; Wang, Yongjie] Capital Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, 105 Xisanhuanbeilu, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China","Wang, YJ (corresponding author), Capital Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, 105 Xisanhuanbeilu, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China.",wangyjosmy@gmail.com,,,"National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31301905, 41688103, 41372013]; Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of ChinaResearch Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China (RFDP)Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education (SRFDP) [20131108120005]; Youth Innovative Research Team of Capital Normal University; Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in UniversityProgram for Changjiang Scholars & Innovative Research Team in University (PCSIRT) [IRT-17R75]","We thank Dr. Chungkun Shih (College of Life Sciences, Capital Normal University) for improving the manuscript.

Despite great interest, a well resolved and complete phylogeny of the group and a reliable chronogram have been elusive due to their broad geographic distribution, paucity of samples, and challenging molecular composition. Here we present a molecular phylogenetic analysis of Onychophora that includes previously unsampled and undersampled lineages and we analyse the expanded dataset using a series of nested taxon sets designed to increase the amount of information available for particular subclades. These include a dataset with outgroups, one restricted to the ingroup taxa, and three others for Peripatopsidae, Peripatidae and Neopatida (= the Neotropical Peripatidae). To explore competing biogeographic scenarios we generate a new time tree for Onychophora using the few available reliable fossils as calibration points. Comparing our results to those of Cyphophthalmi, we reconsider the hypothesis that velvet worms reached Southeast Asia via Eurogondwana, and conclude that a more likely scenario is that they reached Southeast Asia by rafting on the Sibumasu terrane. Our phylogenetic results support the reciprocal monophyly of both families as well as an early division between East and West Gondwana, also in both families, each beginning to diversify between the Permian and the Jurassic. Peripatopsidae clearly supports paraphyly of South Africa with respect to southern South America (Chile) and a sister group relationship of the Southeast Asian/New Guinean Paraperipatus to the Australian/New Zealand taxa. The latter includes a clade that divides between Western Australia and Eastern Australia and two sister clades of trans-Tasman species (one oviparous and one viviparous). This pattern clearly shows that oviparity is secondarily derived in velvet worms. Peripatidae finds a sister group relationship between the Southeast Asian Eoperipatus and the West Gondwanan clade, which divides into the African Mesoperipatus and Neopatida. The latter shows a well supported split between the Pacific Oroperipatus (although it is unclear whether they form one or two clades) and a sister clade that includes the members of the genera Peripatus, Epiperipatus, Macroperipatus and representatives of the monotypic genera Cerradopatus, Plicatoperipatus and Principapillatus. However, Peripatus, Epiperipatus and Macroperipatus are not monophyletic, and all the species from the monotypic genera are related to geographically close species. The same goes for the type species of Macroperipatus (from Trinidad, and sister group to other Trinidad and Tobago species of Epiperipatus) and Epiperipatus (from French Guiana, and related to other Guyana shield species of Epiperipatus and Peripatus). Geographic structure within Neopatida is largely obscured by an unresolved backbone, but many well supported instances of generic non-monophyly challenge the current taxonomic framework, which has often relied on anatomical characters that are untested phylogenetically.","[Giribet, Gonzalo; Buckman-Young, Rebecca S.; Costa, Cristiano Sampaio; Baker, Caitlin M.; Benavides, Ligia R.] Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Museum Comparat Zool, 26 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA; [Buckman-Young, Rebecca S.] Univ Wisconsin, Dept Integrat Biol, 250 N Mills St, Madison, WI 53706 USA; [Costa, Cristiano Sampaio; Pinto-da-Rocha, Ricardo] Univ Sao Paulo, Inst Biociencias, Dept Zool, Rua Matao Travessa 14,321 Cidade Univ, BR-05508090 Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil; [Branstetter, Michael G.] Utah State Univ, USDA ARS, Pollinating Insects Res Unit, Logan, UT 84322 USA; [Daniels, Savel R.] Univ Stellenbosch, Dept Bot & Zool, Private Bag X1, ZA-7602 Matieland, South Africa","Giribet, G (corresponding author), Harvard Univ, Dept Organism & Evolutionary Biol, Museum Comparat Zool, 26 Oxford St, Cambridge, MA 02138 USA.",ggiribet@g.harvard.edu,"Pinto-da-Rocha, Ricardo/J-6774-2012; Buckman-Young, Rebecca/C-4271-2019; Costa, Cristiano Sampaio/X-6310-2018; Giribet, Gonzalo/P-1086-2015","Pinto-da-Rocha, Ricardo/0000-0002-3959-2205; Costa, Cristiano Sampaio/0000-0002-0047-9328; Giribet, Gonzalo/0000-0002-5467-8429","NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1457539, DEB-1144417, DOB-1343578]; National Geographic Society: Re-discovering the mite harvestmen (Arachnida, Opiliones, Cyphophthalmi, Neogoveidae) of the Brazilian Amazonas [9043-11]; MCZ; Putnam Expedition Grants Program from the MCZ; NSF GRFP FellowshipNational Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Office of the Director (OD); FAPESPFundacao de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPESP) [2011/20211-0, 2012/02969-6, 2014/20557-2]; NSFNational Science Foundation (NSF)","Many colleagues have assisted with field work and permits, including Miquel Arnedo, Jimmy Cabra, Pio Colmenares, Julia Cosgrove, Rosa Fernandez, Mark Harvey, Gustavo Hormiga, Ana Tourinho, Willians Porto.

In this paper we describe an example of exceptional soft-bodied preservation in a fossil terrestrial mollusk-a snail shell with some tissue, including part of the cephalic region (head) with a tentacle and inferred eye stalk, and potentially part of the foot and operculum. The snail, a probable juvenile, is preserved in Burmese amber (Burmite) from Myanmar, of earliest Cenomanian age. Morphological evidence suggests a cyclophoroidean ancestry and a possible attribution to the family Cyclophoridae: members of this superfamily are widespread today in Asia, thus indicating a long geological history in the region.

Herein, Kachinia cretacea gen. et sp. nov., ascribed to Schizopteridae: Hypselosomatinae, is described based on a female adult in mid-Cretaceous Kachin amber from northern Myanmar. The new taxon shares some primitive traits with other Mesozoic schizopterids, but also derived a series of autapomorphic characteristics. The two Mesozoic schizopterid genera Hexaphlebia and Lumatibialis, which have not been assigned to subfamily level, are tentatively treated as early representatives of Hypselosomatinae based on their complex tegminal venation similar to that of the genus Hypselosoma. Additionally, a key to all known fossil species of Schizopteridae is provided on the basis of tegminal features. Our findings further confirm Schizopteridae as one of the basal clades of Dipsocoromorpha, being highly diversified and widespread by the late Mesozoic. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The present study introduces some angiosperms and insects in Burmese amber whose closest extant relatives have a Gondwanan distribution and there is no previous evidence of a Laurasian distribution. Based on this evidence, it is proposed that organisms in Burmese amber represent a selection of tropical to subtropical life forms that inhabited the interconnected continents of Gondwana in the Early Cretaceous.

The individuals of F. xiai show a considerable variation in length/width ratio of both the crown and the tegmen as well as tegminal cell patterns, but they are assigned to the same species since a similar intra-specific variation has been well documented in Mesozoic Cercopoidea. Mesolongicapitis peii gen. et sp. nov. is remarkably different from all known sinoalids by displaying a series of novel morphological traits, e.g., specialized compound eyes, and the tegmen with an extremely long MP+CuA stalk and an extremely short RA(1) . Its crown with distinct epicranial suture and anterior arms, and its frons with a median ocellus are similar to those of the Middle to Late Jurassic sinoalids from northeastern China, resembling the basal model of Clypeata.

Highresolution three-dimensional images using X-ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) are provided.

The detailed morphologies of the new taxa are explored, especially notable is a nearly complete foveal pattern that is described for the first time for a fossil pselaphine. The integration of Priscaplectus into a phylogenetic context using combined morphological and molecular dataset suggested an affinity to Euplectitae.

Based on the presence of a pair of pronotal callosities, Cretoboganium can be firmly placed in the extant subfamily Boganiinae, a small group currently comprising two small austral genera. Our discovery represents the first fossil record for Boganiinae. It also demonstrates another example that an apparently austral group may have its sister group occurred in today's northern hemisphere. Together with the other fossil boganiid known from the Middle Jurassic of China, the finding suggests that Boganiidae is an ancient and relict group. Moreover, the present biogeographic distribution of Boganiinae is indicative of an earlier origin of this subfamily, which likely originated before the breakup of the Gondwanan supercontinent.

Here, a remarkable new genus and species, Propiestus archaicus gen. et sp. nov., is described based on a well-preserved individual in Upper Cretaceous Burmese amber from northern Myanmar (Cenomanian, c. 99 Ma). It represents the first piestine fossil found in Mesozoic amber. The fine morphological characters preserved as an amber inclusion enable a confident systematic placement within the subfamily based on both our detailed observations and phylogenetic analyses. The resulting trees revealed a strongly supported sister-group relationship with the extant genus Piestus, comprising all currently known piestine species from the Neotropical region and one from the Nearctic. Our new discovery is congruent with a hypothesis of the Gondwanan affinity of insects found from Burmese amber. Considering the geological data as well as several previous studies, the current distribution of Piestus could possibly be explained by either a relictual Gondwanan distribution or the widespread presence of the clade Propiestus + Piestus on Pangea, rather than subsequent dispersal events during the Cenozoic. Nonetheless, more evidence is needed to corroborate the true biogeographical origin and past distribution of this clade. In agreement with strong external similarities with living Piestinae, Propiestus probably exhibits a specialized body plan, including a flattened body, long, slender antennae and short legs, suggesting that it inhabited microhabitats under the bark of rotting wood as do its modern congeners.","[Yamamoto, Shuhei] Field Museum Nat Hist, Integrat Res Ctr, 1400 S Lake Shore Dr, Chicago, IL 60605 USA; [Yamamoto, Shuhei] Kyushu Univ Museum, Hakozaki 6-10-1, Fukuoka, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan; [Caron, Edilson; Bortoluzzi, Sidnei] Univ Fed Parana, Biodivers Dept, Rua Pioneiro 2153, BR-85950000 Palotina, PR, Brazil","Yamamoto, S (corresponding author), Field Museum Nat Hist, Integrat Res Ctr, 1400 S Lake Shore Dr, Chicago, IL 60605 USA.; Yamamoto, S (corresponding author), Kyushu Univ Museum, Hakozaki 6-10-1, Fukuoka, Fukuoka 8128581, Japan.",s.yamamoto.64@gmail.com,"Yamamoto, Shuhei/U-8247-2018","Yamamoto, Shuhei/0000-0002-4162-8457; Caron, Edilson/0000-0001-7136-2218","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS, Tokyo, Japan) Overseas Research FellowshipMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [29-212]","We are very grateful to Adam Brunke (Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Ottawa, Canada) for checking the English language of the manuscript.

C. burmensis is assigned to the subfamily Tettigarctinae, providing several peculiar features that are not found in the extant representatives of Tettigarctinae: apex of fore femur armed with distal conical spine; hind tibia armed with three lateral spines; ScP + R branching distinctly after MP branching; MP3+4 connecting CuA(1) by cross vein m-cu. The other species V. parallelica is tentatively assigned to the tribe Turutanoviini of Cicadoprosbolinae. C. burmensis resembles Sunotettigarcta hirsuta from the Middle-Upper Jurassic of Daohugou beds (northeastern China) in its general characters of wing venation and pronotum, which suggests a close relationship between the Daohugou and Burmese amber biotas. It likely reveals a range shift southwards after the Daohugou palaeoecosystem collapsed during the Late Jurassic in north China.

Burmese amber is the oldest Lagerstatte where both diverse webspinners and sclerogibbids are found. In this paper, Sclerogibba cretacica sp. nov. is described from Late Cretaceous Burmese (Myanmar) amber. The new species, assigned to the extant genus Sclerogibba Riggio & De Stefani-Perez, 1888, is the fourth known fossil species of Sclerogibbidae and the first known fossil male of this family. Moreover, this is the first described sclerogibbid wasp from Burmese amber and the first known fossil species of Sclerogibba. Sclerogibba cretacica is similar to extant sclerogibbid wasps with a closed discoidal cell from South-East Asia, but differs in the shape of the discoidal cell and small number of antennomeres (19 only). The phylogenetic significance of this species is discussed. Evolutionary trends in the antennal polymorphism of sclerogibbid wasps since the Cretaceous are outlined. The records of fossil webspinners, their ancestors (Alexrasniidae) and sclerogibbids suggest a Laurasian origin of Sclerogibbidae. The genus Protosclerogibba Olmi, Marletta, Guglielmino & Speranza, 2016 is synonymized with Herpetosphex Arnold, 1940 (Pompilidae) and Protosclerogibba australis Olmi, Marletta, Guglielmino & Speranza, 2016 is synonymized with Herpetosphex staphylinoides Arnold, 1940 (new synonyms).","[Martynova, Kateryna V.; Perkovsky, Evgeny E.] Natl Acad Sci Ukraine, Schmalhausen Inst Zool, B Khmelnitskogo 15, UA-01601 Kiev, Ukraine; [Olmi, Massimo] Trop Entomol Res Ctr, Via Gasperi 10, I-01100 Viterbo, Italy; [Mueller, Patrick] Friedhofstr 9, D-66894 Kashofen, Germany","Martynova, KV (corresponding author), Natl Acad Sci Ukraine, Schmalhausen Inst Zool, B Khmelnitskogo 15, UA-01601 Kiev, Ukraine.",martynova_kv@ukr.net,,"Martynova, Kateryna/0000-0002-9896-3504; Perkovsky, Evgeny/0000-0002-7959-4379",,,,56,9,11,1,3,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1477-2019,1478-0941,,J SYST PALAEONTOL,J.

For a better understanding of the timing and pattern of millipede evolution, Burmese amber offers a unique window into the Cretaceous period, ca. 99 Ma. Here, we describe the first known fossil of the colobognathan order Platydesmida, the species Andrognathus burmiticus n. sp. based on 15 specimens from Cretaceous Burmese amber. We combine classical light-microscopy and modern micro-computer tomography (mu CT) with computer aided 3D-reconstructions. These non-invasive techniques allow us to describe the fossil millipedes as detailed as is general practice for extant species, and to grant the scientific community open access to the deposited Cybertypes. Based on the combination of unique morphological characters such as surface structures, body type, the unique size and shape of tergite 5, the absence of a hypoproct at the anal segment, and detailed gonopod characteristics, the studied fossils can be placed in the family Andrognathidae and the extant genus Andrognathus, which nowadays is restricted to the eastern USA and Mexico with three extant species. Therefore, the minimum age of the genus Andrognathus is pushed to the Cenomanian, 99 Ma. It can be assumed that the genus was much more diverse and wider distributed in the past and migrated between Asia and America via one of the once existing land bridges. These unique fossils prove the unusual relictual distribution of Andrognathus and can serve as key-fossils for the dating of the diplopod phylogeny.","[Moritz, Leif; Wesener, Thomas] Leibniz Inst Anim Biodivers, Zool Res Museum Alexander Koenig ZFMK, Adenauerallee 160, D-53113 Bonn, Germany","Moritz, L (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Anim Biodivers, Zool Res Museum Alexander Koenig ZFMK, Adenauerallee 160, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",moritz.leif@gmail.com,"Moritz, Leif/AAF-9547-2020","Moritz, Leif/0000-0002-6028-5189",Alexander Koenig Stiftung (AKS),"We want to express our gratitude to Patrick Muller for the opportunity to work on his unique collection of millipedes in Burmese amber and for the donation of several valuable specimens to the collection of the Zoological Research Museum A.

The extant family Platystictidae is one of the most diverse Zygoptera, but short of fossil records. In this paper, a new species, Mesosticta davidattenboroughi sp. nov., is described from mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber, representing the third-known fossil species of Platystictidae. Mesosticta davidattenboroughi sp. nov. has a long IR1 beginning one cell distal of the base of RP2, confirming the previous attribution of Mesosticta Huang, Azar, Cai & Nel, 2015 to Platystictidae. It differs from other species of Mesosticta in having a long IR1 and a basally crossed subdiscoidal cell. The fossil genus Mesosticta shares the diagnostic characters of the modern platystictid genera, viz. a basally recessed 'CuP' (shared by all species), a very long IR1 (only in Mesosticta davidattenboroughi sp. nov.), and a specialized subdiscoidal area mostly rhomboidal in shape (only in Mesosticta electronica Zheng, Zhang, Chang & Wang, 2016). Based on the platystictid damselflies from Burmese amber, a new subfamily Mesostictinae subfam. nov. is established. Mesostictinae subfam. nov. represents the first fossil group of modern platystictid damselflies, documenting the appearance of Platystictidae as early as mid-Cretaceous. It differs from modern Platystictidae by the presence of fewer postnodal and postsubnodal crossveins, a short MP, the base of RP2 being nearer to the subnodus and the nodus lying more distally.","[Zheng, Daran; Wang, Bo; Jarzembowski, Edmund A.; Zhang, Haichun] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Daran; Chang, Su-Chin] Univ Hong Kong, Dept Earth Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, 1 Beichen West Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Nel, Andre] UPMC, Sorbonne Univ, Museum Natl Hist Nat,UMR 7205,Entomol, CNRS,MNHN,EPHE,ISYEB,Inst Systemat Evolut Biodive, 57 Rue Cuvier,CP 50, F-75005 Paris, France; [Jarzembowski, Edmund A.] Nat Hist Museum, Dept Earth Sci, London SW7 5BD, England","Zheng, DR (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Zheng, DR; Chang, SC (corresponding author), Univ Hong Kong, Dept Earth Sci, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.",dranzheng@gmail.com; suchin@hku.hk,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41572010, 41622201, 41688103]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [2011224]; HKU Seed Funding Program for Basic ResearchUniversity of Hong Kong [201210159058]","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant numbers 41572010, 41622201, 41688103), Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (grant number2011224), and the HKU Seed Funding Program for Basic Research (grant number 201210159058).

Mymarommatoids were first described as fossils, and although their extant 12 species are distributed worldwide, little is known about their biology. They seem to be absent from the tropics presently, and only two species in two families of Mymarommatoidea are known from the tropical mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber.

We herein report a new true hopper family Minlagerrontidae Chen, Szwedo and Wang fam. nov. with two new species (Minlagerron griphos Chen, Szwedo and Wang gen. et sp. nov. and Minlagerron onyxos Chen, Szwedo and Wang gen. et sp. nov.) in mid-Cretaceous Machin amber from northern Myanmar. The new family, tentatively attributed to Hylicelloidea (Clypeata), shares a series of plesiomorphies with ancient Clypeata, and also bears some extremely unusual or even grotesque morphological characteristics, never recorded in other Clypeata, Hemiptera, or even all fossil and living insects. This family possesses a greatly specialized head with tylus extremely broad, compound eyes produced, postclypeus almost transversely rectangular in the middle, with basal half having a deep longitudinal groove medially, and rostrum stout. The anterior part of minlagerrontid prothorax is sharply constricted, forming a unique 'neck' and 'shoulder' structures, and the prothoracic legs are also highly modified with strengthened femora with several lateral teeth and tibiae deviantly club-shaped. The female pygofer of the new family is completely wrapped by tergite VIII and its ovipositor is short and reduced. Additionally, minlagerrontids possess unique tegmina with C5 almost closed, surrounded by terminal branches of CuA, and thick venation reticular with multiple ambient veins ending at anterior margin and crossveins it and rp-mp diploid. The new highly specialized family erected herein suggests that in the Mesozoic, to reduce mutual competition, ancient Clypeata had diversified multi-dimensionally and so possibly evolved with high disparity to occupy a wide range of ecotypes.

Here, we describe a Mesozoic species of this order, Siphonophora hui sp. nov., based on two well-preserved specimens from mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber. The new species can be placed in the family Siphonophoridae by having mouthparts strongly modified into a long beak, straight antennae, the separation of tergites, pleurites and sternites, leg-like gonopods derived from 9th and 10th leg pairs, and absence of ommatidia. This discovery pushes back the fossil record of Siphonophorida by more than 60 Ma. It also demonstrates that the details of the siphonophorid body plan have remained virtually unchanged for nearly 100 million years. An enigmatic structure on the antennae of the paratype may represent either the ancestral form of the circular sensory pits, or more unlikely, the earliest occurrence of a fungus parasitic or commensal on an arthropod.

Total-evidence phylogenetic reconstruction is being increasingly used to assess the position of extinct taxa by incorporating morphological data from extinct and extant taxa together with molecular data from extant taxa in a united framework. Here we apply the method to two Cretaceous Burmese amber inclusions belonging to the rove beetle subfamily Paederinae. To perform the total evidence analysis, we constructed the first morphological matrix and the most comprehensive molecular dataset for the subfamily. Our analysis reveals an extinct lineage of Paederinae rove beetles with a suite of unique morphological characters, resulting in the description of a new genus: Diminudon gen. nov. and two new species: D. schomannae sp. nov. and D. kachinensis sp. nov. Simultaneously our analyses provide new insights into the evolution and classification of the entire subfamily. We also discuss the unusually small size of the newly described Paederinae, which may represent an additional case for miniaturization in the Cretaceous.","[Zyla, Dagmara; Shaw, Josh Jenkins] Univ Copenhagen, Biosystemat Sect, Nat Hist Museum Denmark, Univ Pk 15, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Zyla, Dagmara] Iowa State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, 2200 Osborn Dr,Bessey Hall, Ames, IA 50011 USA; [Zyla, Dagmara] Univ Gdansk, Dept Invertebrate Zool & Parasitol, Wita Stwosza 59, PL-80308 Gdansk, Poland; [Yamamoto, Shuhei] Field Museum Nat Hist, Integrat Res Ctr, 1400 S Lake Shore Dr, Chicago, IL 60605 USA","Zyla, D (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Biosystemat Sect, Nat Hist Museum Denmark, Univ Pk 15, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.; Zyla, D (corresponding author), Iowa State Univ, Dept Ecol Evolut & Organismal Biol, 2200 Osborn Dr,Bessey Hall, Ames, IA 50011 USA.; Zyla, D (corresponding author), Univ Gdansk, Dept Invertebrate Zool & Parasitol, Wita Stwosza 59, PL-80308 Gdansk, Poland.",zyladagmara@gmail.com; s.yamamoto.64@gmail.com; joshjenkins@btinternet.com,"Yamamoto, Shuhei/U-8247-2018","Yamamoto, Shuhei/0000-0002-4162-8457; Zyla, Dagmara/0000-0003-4959-763X",,,,89,6,6,2,7,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0031-0239,1475-4983,,PALAEONTOLOGY,Paleontology,NOV,2019,62,6,,,,,935,949,,10.1111/pala.12435,,,15,Paleontology,Paleontology,JU0PF,WOS:000501381000004,,,,,20/07/2021

Recently, they were reported to be associated with Burmese amber. However, most of specimens from previous reports were preserved on the amber surface or within the sediment surrounding the amber. Based on X-ray tomography and thin-section optical microscopy of Burmese amber, we report here the first genuine and unambiguous evidence of inclusion of crinoid ossicles preserved in the fossil resin. Preservation of this exclusively marine group in amber gives insights into the paleoenvironment of the crinoid-amber association and provides additional evidence to support previous observations of shallow-water stalked crinoids from the mid-Cretaceous, when many stalked crinoids started to shift offshore due to increased predation pressure during the Mesozoic Marine Revolution. Crinoid remains, represented by disarticulated stem and arm ossicles assignable to Isocrinus cf. legeri (Repelin), point to a mid-Cretaceous age for the Burmese amber and support some previous hypotheses suggesting a close proximity between the resin-producing trees and seawater.","[Salamon, Mariusz A.] Univ Silesia Katowice, Fac Earth Sci, Bedzinska St 60, PL-41200 Sosnowiec, Poland; [Lin, Jih-Pai] Natl Taiwan Univ, Dept Geosci, 1,Sec 4,Roosevelt Rd, Taipei 106, Taiwan; [Duda, Pioir] Univ Silesia Katowice, Fac Comp Seienee & Mat Sci, 75 Pulku Piechoty 1, PL-41500 Chorzow, Poland; [Gorzelak, Przhmyslaw] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Paleobiol, Twarda 51-55, PL-00815 Warsaw, Poland; [Ausich, William, I] Ohio State Univ, Sch Earth Sci, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; [Oji, Tatsuo] Nagoya Univ, Univ Museum, Furo Cho, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan","Salamon, MA (corresponding author), Univ Silesia Katowice, Fac Earth Sci, Bedzinska St 60, PL-41200 Sosnowiec, Poland.",xyloplax1@gmail.com,"Gorzelak, Przemyslaw/B-6329-2015; Oji, Tatsuo/A-1840-2009","Gorzelak, Przemyslaw/0000-0001-5706-1881; Oji, Tatsuo/0000-0002-1034-1111; Duda, Piotr/0000-0003-3575-5641; Salamon, Mariusz/0000-0001-9399-2798","European Regional Development Fund within the Innovation Economy Operational Programme [POIG.02.02.00-00-025/09]; Taiwan-ROC Ministry of Science and Technology grants [MOST 105-2116-M-002-012, MOST 106-2116-M-002-018, MOST 107-2116-M-002-007]","This work has been benefited from constructive comments raised by James Saulsbury, anonymous reviewer and Associate Editor (Samuel Zamora).

The species shows some resemblance with the mecopteran family Bittacidae, mainly due to strongly elongated and thin legs. However, the structural affinities are apparently due to convergency. Different features, but especially the mouthparts and the pattern of wing venation, indicate that the species belongs to the extinct order t Permopsocida (?Archipsyllidae). However, it differs markedly from all species previously described in this extinct group. The very thin and strongly elongated legs are probably autapomorphic. A very unusual feature is the antenna with only seven segments and extremely elongated flagellomeres. The two pairs of wings are unusually narrow. M and CuA are basally fused. Proximal rows of spines, two series of closed cells, and a distinctly increased number of terminal branches of M are present in the forewings, in contrast to other archipsyllid genera. It is conceivable that Bittacopsocus megacephalus used its long legs to rest suspended in the vegetation like Bittacus.

The earliest known suspicious mating behavior of Zoraptera, the intromittent organ of the fossil zorapterans, the egg, and the earliest known basal plate of the male genitalia are briefly discussed. The genitalia of new species are used as an intromittent organ in the majority of mating patterns among living zorapterans.

By having some peculiarities in the body shape and structure of the head (elongate mandibles, reduced eyes, additional setigerous pores on frons and vertex), the new genus is rather distinct from the two modern genera Metrius Eschscholtz, 1829 and Sinometrius Wrase et Schmidt, 2006, each with restricted distribution in western North America (Metrius) and in East Asia (Sinometrius). Like the modern members of Metriini, the new genus could inhabit forests and keep a predaceous mode of life. A compact body with legs not adapted to digging and reduced eyes in Kryzhanovskiana olegi gen. et sp. nov. seem to indicate on inhabitance in dark enclosed interspaces, such as thick layers of dead wood or hollows in rotten tree trunks. The discovery of a new remarkable representative of the tribe Metriini in Cretaceous Burmese amber confirms the previous suggestions that Metriini represent an old relict group of Carabidae which was more diverse and more widely distributed in the past.

B. compactus is the oldest amber inclusion of a net-winged beetle. The discovery suggests the start of Lycidae diversification at least in the Mid-Cretaceous. The fossil was discovered in the area of the highest phylogenetic diversity of extant net-winged beetles, in deposits with a rich beetles fauna. The species is a member of the putative early radiation of this family and shows relationships with Afrotropical Dexorinae from which it differs in the dilated apical palpomeres, serrate antennae, and fully metamorphosed females. Burmolycus compactus shares 10-segmented antennae with several genera with proved or hypothesized neotenic females. The general appearance of Cretaceous B. compactus is surprisingly similar to extant net-winged beetles and may represent the example of their long-term morphological stasis. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Five of them have unusually modified mouthparts with a strongly transformed labium, which shows features interpreted as adaptations to suctorial feeding. Among the hyperdiverse Coleoptera, similar feeding adaptations are known only in several genera of Cerylonidae and Leiodidae. Fossils attributed to Eucinetidae or representing taxa presumably closely related to eucinetids are known from Lower Cretaceous of China and Upper Jurassic of Mongolia, but none of them shows modified mouthparts. The first fossil of a 'suctorial eucinetid', dagger Cretohlezkus alleni gen. et sp. nov., is reported in the present paper, based on a well-preserved specimen in Cenomanian Burmese amber. A preliminary phylogenetic analysis placed dagger Cretohlezkus near base of the monophyletic 'suctorial eucinetid' lineage, but branch support was too low to present a robust evolutionary hypothesis. The prementum of dagger Cretohlezkus is modified as strongly as that of extant members of this group, demonstrating early origins of still only speculative feeding habits of the 'suctorial eucinetids', which presumably use Myxomycetes or Basidiomycetes as the source of food.

Here, we report two new species Acalyptomerus thayerae sp. nov. and Sphaerothorax uenoi sp. nov., both belonging to extant genera of Clambidae, from mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber. Acalyptomerus thayerae has a close affinity to A. herbertfranzi, a species currently occurring in Mesoamerica and northern South America. Sphaerothorax uenoi is closely related to extant species of Sphaerothorax, which are usually collected in forests of Nothofagus of Australia, Chile, and New Zealand. The discovery of two Cretaceous species from northern Myanmar indicates that both genera had lengthy evolutionary histories, originated at least by the earliest Cenomanian, and were probably more widespread than at present. Remarkable morphological similarities between fossil and living species suggest that both genera changed little over long periods of geological time.

Many polyneopteran insects with euplantulae, for example, Grylloblattodea, Mantophasmatodea and Orthoptera, have been described from the Mesozoic. However, the origin and evolution of stick insects' euplantulae are poorly understood due to rare fossil records. Here, we report the earliest fossil records of Timematodea hitherto, Tumefactipes prolongates gen. et sp. nov. and Granosicorpes lirates gen. et sp. nov., based on three specimens from mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber. Specimens of Tumefactipes prolongates gen. et sp. nov. have extremely specialized and expanded euplantulae on their tarsomere II. These new findings are the first known and the earliest fossil records about euplantula structure within Phasmatodea, demonstrating the diversity of euplantulae in Polyneoptera during the Mesozoic. Such tarsal pads might have increased friction and helped these mid-Cretaceous stick insects to climb more firmly on various surfaces, such as broad leaves, wetted tree branches or ground. These specimens provide more morphological data for us to understand the relationships of Timematodea, Euphasmatodea, Orthoptera and Embioptera, suggesting that Timematodea might be monophyletic with Euphasmatodea rather than Embioptera and Phasmatodea should have a closer relationship with Orthoptera rather than Embioptera.","[Chen, Sha; Shih, Chungkun; Ren, Dong; Gao, Tai-Ping] Capital Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, 105 Xisanhuanbeilu, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China; [Deng, Shi-Wo; Zhang, Peng; Zhu, Yi-Ning] Capital Normal Univ, Sch Math Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Shih, Chungkun] Smithsonian Inst, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Dept Paleobiol, Washington, DC 20560 USA; [Zhang, Wei-Wei] POB 4680, Chongqing, Peoples R China","Zhu, YN; Gao, TP (corresponding author), Capital Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, 105 Xisanhuanbeilu, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China.",ynzhu@cnu.edu.cn; tpgao@cnu.edu.cn,"Gao, Taiping/Z-3987-2019","Gao, Taiping/0000-0002-8118-8708","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31730087, 41688103, 31672323]; Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in UniversityProgram for Changjiang Scholars & Innovative Research Team in University (PCSIRT) [IRT-17R75]; Support Project of High-level Teachers in Beijing Municipal Universities in the Period of 13th Five-year Plan [IDHT20180518]; Young Elite Scientist Sponsorship Program by CAST; Beijing Natural Science FoundationBeijing Natural Science Foundation [5182004]; Youth Innovative Research Team of Capital Normal University","We are grateful to Dr. Michael S.

This new species is distinct from Corethrella andersoni, known from the same deposit, differing in having more slender mid femora and a triangular bifid tarsal segment 5 without scales. These two species, however, share an apparent synapomorphy in the wing; R-2 vein diverting from R2+3 at 75 degrees angle in relation to R-3.

A phylogenetic analysis of all Phoroidea families, including all ironomyiid extant and extinct genera, corroborates the monophyly of Ironomyiidae, and Macalpinomyia gen.n. is assigned to the subfamily Sinolestinae.

These are predators with mouthparts modified into venom-injecting stylets. These stylets can take various forms, especially in relation to their body. Especially large stylets are known in larva of the neuropteran ingroups Osmylidae (giant lacewings or lance lacewings) and Sisyridae (spongilla flies). Here the stylets are straight, the bodies are rather slender. In the better known larvae of Myrmeleontidae (ant lions) and their relatives (e.g. owlflies, Ascalaphidae) stylets are curved and bear numerous prominent teeth. Here the stylets can also reach large sizes; the body and especially the head are relatively broad. We here describe a new type of larva from Burmese amber (100 million years old) with very prominent curved stylets, yet body and head are rather slender. Such a combination is unknown in the modern fauna. We provide a comparison with other fossil neuropteran larvae that show some similarities with the new larva. The new larva is unique in processing distinct protrusions on the trunk segments. Also the ratio of the length of the stylets vs. the width of the head is the highest ratio among all neuropteran larvae with curved stylets and reaches values only found in larvae with straight mandibles. We discuss possible phylogenetic systematic interpretations of the new larva and aspects of the diversity of neuropteran larvae in the Cretaceous.","[Haug, Joachim T.; Haug, Carolin] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Biol 2, Bioctr, Grosshaderner Str 2, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany; [Haug, Joachim T.; Haug, Carolin] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, GeoBioctr, Richard Wagner Str 10, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Mueller, Patrick] Friedhofstr 9, D-66894 Kashofen, Germany","Haug, JT (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Biol 2, Bioctr, Grosshaderner Str 2, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany.; Haug, JT (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, GeoBioctr, Richard Wagner Str 10, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",joachim.haug@palaeo-evo-devo.info,,,Volkswagen FoundationVolkswagen; LMUexcellent Junior Researcher Fund,"The Volkswagen Foundation kindly funds JTH with a Lichtenberg Professorship.

This stems, in part, from a lack of exceptionally preserved fossils from the Mesozoic and of formal phylogenetic study of both extant and extinct taxa. Here we describe and illustrate a new fossil from mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber, and provide a phylogeny combining both fossils and all known extant genera of Archostemata. A dataset of 43 ingroup taxa and four outgroup taxa based on 110 morphological characters was analysed under parsimony. The results indicate that Priacma LeConte and Paracupes Kolbe, as well as the Cretaceous genera Barbaticupes Jarzembowski et al. and Mallecupes Jarzembowski et al., together form a sister clade to the rest of Cupedidae. Priacma megapuncta sp.n. is attributed to the relict North American Priacma by the presence of distinct subtruncate elytral apices, lateral elytral margins with two rows of sharp teeth, and peculiar fixing epipleural folds near the elytral apices. Our discovery of the first fossil species of Priacma in Burmese amber reveals the antiquity and wider distribution of the genus in the late Mesozoic.

Fossil records of this large tribe are rare, and are mostly confined to Eocene to Miocene amber, whereas only four genera were known from Mesozoic deposits. Here we report a new Mesozoic taxon, Pangusyndicus excavatus Yin, Zhou & Cai gen. et sp. nov., from Cenomanian Burmese amber. For the first time the ventral cephalic structures of an extinct Glandulariini are observable, a character system usually difficult to discern, especially in fossil scydmaenines. Pangusyndicus clearly lacks lateral sulci on the submentum, a critical character state that justifies the placement of Pangusyndicus in one of the two assumedly natural groups' of Glandulariini. Pangusyndicus displays strongly reduced antennomeres XI, similar to those found only in the extant Australo-Oriental genus Syndicus Motschulsky. To test the phylogenetic position of Pangusyndicus, cladistic analyses were performed based on morphological data. Both parsimonious and maximum likelihood cladograms recovered a close relationship between Pangusyndicus, Syndicus and Loeblites Franz, indicating the unique reduction of apical antennomeres in this group may have originated once, and by the mid-Cretaceous at the latest. More strikingly, Pangusyndicus possesses a large cavity on the mediobasal surface of the pronotal disc, a feature previously unknown among all scydmaenines. We interpret this as a specialized glandular structure, although its function remains uncertain. The presence of such a cavity in Pangusyndicus represents the earliest known presumably glandular structure in Staphylinidae. Moreover, Pangusyndicus and several recently described mid-Cretaceous scydmaenines belonging to various tribes exhibit notably longer legs than their extant relatives, indicating shifts in habitat and prey preferences may have occurred during the evolution of these groups.http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:11529A5C-DAF3-4AD9-A074-10E937CE75C","[Yin, Ziwei; Zhou, Deyao] Shanghai Normal Univ, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Dept Biol, Shanghai 200234, Peoples R China; [Cai, Chenyang] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, Key Lab Econ Stratig & Palaeogeog, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Cai, Chenyang] Univ Bristol, Sch Earth Sci, Bristol BS8 1TQ, Avon, England; [Huang, Diying] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Cai, Chenyang; Huang, Diying] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Engel, Michael S.] Univ Kansas, Div Entomol, Nat Hist Museum, 1501 Crestline Dr,Suite 140, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Engel, Michael S.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 1501 Crestline Dr,Suite 140, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Engel, Michael S.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, Cent Pk West 79th St, New York, NY 10024 USA","Cai, CY (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, Key Lab Econ Stratig & Palaeogeog, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Cai, CY (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Sch Earth Sci, Bristol BS8 1TQ, Avon, England.; Cai, CY (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",cycai@nigpas.ac.cn,"Engel, Michael S/C-5461-2012","Engel, Michael S/0000-0003-3067-077X","Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB26000000]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41602009, 41688103]; US National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [DEB-1144162]","We thank Pawel Jaoszyski (Wrocaw, Poland) for providing comments on an early draft of the manuscript.

On the basis of new fossil data and phylogenetic analyses, this froghopper family is herein chosen as a case study to discuss the potential influence of the absence and/or neglect of body information in palaeoentomological studies. Mesodorus orientalis Chen et Wang, gen. et sp. nov., found in the mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber, bears a venational topology of fore- and hindwings similar to that of the genus Fangyuania from the same horizon and locality, but distinctly differs from the latter and other known sinoalids in possessing a series of unique body characters. Given the similar wing features, Jiania crebra and J. gracila were proposed to be synonyms in a recent study; these two congeners, however, are apparently discernable in their ovipositor and so the synonym should be rejected. Three main clades were recovered within the Sinoalidae in our cladistic analyses, including Clade I (Stictocercopis + Chengdecercopis), Clade II (Huabeicercopis + Luanpingia + Sinoala + Jiania + Shufania), and Clade III (Fangyuania + Mesodorus), and their relationship is as following: Clade I + (Clade II+Clade III). The Jurassic Clade I, as the basal lineage, is remarkably different from other sinoalids in bearing wings with complex venation, but similar to the Jurassic Clade II in body structures. The Cretaceous Clade III possesses a reduced wing topology similar to Clade II, but differs from the latter in possessing a series of novel body characteristics for each taxon (i.e., Fangyuania and Mesodorus). Unsurprisingly, our finds confirm that the information from body structures, vital to understanding the biodiversity and evolutionary history of extinct insects, should not be ignored in palaeoentomological studies.","[Chen, Jun; Zheng, Yan; Zhang, Junqiang; An, Baizheng] Linyi Univ, Inst Geol & Paleontol, Shuangling Rd, Linyi 276000, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Chen, Jun; Wang, Bo; Zheng, Yan; Jiang, Hui; Zhang, Haichun] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Chen, Jun; Wang, Bo; Zheng, Yan; Jiang, Hui; Zhang, Haichun] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, 1 Beichen West Rd, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Hui] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Tian] China Univ Geosci, State Key Lab Biogeol & Environm Geol, Xueyuan Lu 29, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China","Chen, J (corresponding author), Linyi Univ, Inst Geol & Paleontol, Shuangling Rd, Linyi 276000, Shandong, Peoples R China.; Chen, J; Zhang, HC (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",rubiscada@sina.com; hczhang@nigpas.ac.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41502007, 41702012, 41572010, 41622201, 41688103]; Natural Scientific Foundation of Shandong ProvinceNatural Science Foundation of Shandong Province [ZR2016DB24, ZR2016DL04]; China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2017M621582]; State Key Laboratory of Palaeobiology and Stratigraphy (Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, CAS)Chinese Academy of Sciences [183105]; Strategic Priority Research Program (B) of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB26000000]","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41502007; 41702012; 41572010; 41622201; 41688103), the Natural Scientific Foundation of Shandong Province (ZR2016DB24; ZR2016DL04), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2017M621582), the State Key Laboratory of Palaeobiology and Stratigraphy (Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, CAS) (No. 183105), and the Strategic Priority Research Program (B) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDB26000000).",,63,13,14,0,6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1439-6092,1618-1077,,ORG DIVERS EVOL,Org.

The evolutionary history of Nemopteridae is largely unknown due to the scarcity of fossil records. Here we report a new genus and species of Nemopteridae (Cretocroce xiai gen. et sp.n.) based on an exquisitely preserved adult specimen in mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber. We place the new genus in the subfamily Crocinae, which is characterized by filamentous hindwings with a sensory function as an adaptation to their cavernicolous habitats. The new genus represents the first nemopterid in amber and the oldest crocine known to date. The new fossil crocine is nearly morphologically unchanged over 99 Ma compared with its modern counterparts. Moreover, it is estimated to be closely related to some extant crocines endemic to South America based on morphological phylogenetic analysis. The new finding provides direct evidence to demonstrate the antiquity of Crocinae morphological innovation and related biology, such as pollenophagous habits, and further corroborates Gondwanan origin of the subfamily.","[Lu, Xiumei; Liu, Xingyue] China Agr Univ, Dept Entomol, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lu, Xiumei] Shanghai Acad Agr Sci, Inst Ecol & Environm Protect, Shanghai 201403, Peoples R China","Liu, XY (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Dept Entomol, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",xingyue_liu@yahoo.com,"Liu, Xingyue/A-3019-2013","Liu, Xingyue/0000-0002-9168-0659; Lu, Xiumei/0000-0002-3494-7871","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31672322, 41572010, 41622201, 41688103]; Beijing Natural Science FoundationBeijing Natural Science Foundation [5162016]; Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDPB05]","We thank Mr Fangyuan Xia (Shanghai) for providing the amber specimen herein studied.

A specimen of the extinct predatory cockroach Stavba babkaeva gen. et sp. n. from Cretaceous Myanmar amber (98 Ma) shows symptoms of Deformed Wing Virus infection caused by pathogenic DWV-Iflavirus. The hindwing is undeveloped and both curled forewings are symmetrically deformed, differing from environmentally caused asymmetries known from Pripyat and Fukushima. While some unknown cockroach mutation might have the same symptoms, ontogenetic defects (such as incomplete moulting) differ in complete lack of sclerotization, modified forewing bases and presence onboth wings. Post-depositional, taphonomic influence can be excluded due to local character of the deformation (forewings on both sides) while other areas are undeformed.

Leptochirini, which is primarily found in decaying wood in the tropics, is one of the four tribes of osoriine rove beetles. The diversity of cephalic tooth shapes in adults has attracted special research attention with regard to the evolution and classification of this group. Here, we report two well-preserved fossils of Leptochirini for the first time from Burmese amber. Together with M. longiantennatus, they represent the oldest osoriines, highlighting the palaeodiversity of the subfamily in Burmese amber. Based on our observations and phylogenetic analyses, a remarkable new genus and species, dagger Cretochirus newtoni Yamamoto gen. et sp.n., is described. Additionally, a new species, dagger Priochirus thayerae Yamamoto sp.n., is also described and placed in the extant genus Priochirus Sharp. dagger Cretochirus gen.n. has a typical body plan of Leptochirini, but it retains several primitive features that have rarely, or never, been known from modern leptochirine taxa, including simple cephalic structures with a largely depressed dorsum, undeveloped cephalic teeth, and the absence of a longitudinal median sulcus of the head, together with the only slightly crenulate external margins of the protibiae. These findings demonstrate the antiquity of Leptochirini rove beetles and even suggest a much older origin of the subfamily. Morphologically diverse leptochirines from Burmese amber also illuminate the remarkable cephalic diversity of the tribe during the Mesozoic. They were already diversified during the mid-Cretaceous in the tropical forests of Myanmar, and possibly living underneath the bark of rotten wood and logs.

Pactopus burmensis n. sp. is described from Burmese amber. A phylogenetic analysis of the known throscid genera is performed. Aulonothroscus Horn and Trixagus Kugelann are shown to be sister-groups, the sister-group of this Glade is the genus Pactopus Horn and the sister group of these three genera is the genus Potergus Bonvouloir. The oldest previously known throscids were species belonging to the genera Rhomboaspis Kirejtshuk & Kovalev and Potergosoma Kirejtshuk & Kovalev, both from Lebanese Amber, 125-135 Mya. The present analysis shows that the extinct Baltic amber genera Jaira Muona and Pseudothroscus belong to clades at least as old as the Lebanese fossils. The Burmese amber fossil Pactopus burmensis, 99 Mya, is considerably older than any of the previously known species belonging to the four extant genera: Pactopus,Potergus, Aulonothroscus or Trixagus. At least three throscid lineages are now known to have gone extinct. Both the Pactopus and Potergus lineages are more than 99 milion years old, whereas the Aulonothroscus and Trixagus lineages extend at least to the Baltic amber, 50 million years ago. The presence of Jaira in Baltic amber shows that that lineage persisted at least 80 million years before going to extinction.","[Muona, Jyrki] Univ Helsinki, Zool Unit, Finnish Museum Nat Hist, Entomol Team, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Muona, J (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Zool Unit, Finnish Museum Nat Hist, Entomol Team, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",Jyrki.muona@helsinki.fi,,"Muona, Jyrki/0000-0003-2771-1171",,,,23,3,4,0,1,MAGNOLIA PRESS,AUCKLAND,"PO BOX 41383, AUCKLAND, ST LUKES 1030, NEW ZEALAND",1175-5326,1175-5334,,ZOOTAXA,Zootaxa,Apr-03,2019,4576,3,,,,,521,543,,10.11646/zootaxa.4576.3.6,,,23,Zoology,Zoology,HR4HT,WOS:000463107300006,31715751,Green Published,,,20/07/2021

However, their symmetric phallic organs comprising two consistent phallomeres are different from those of all living groups. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that the extinct winged taxa, including the new family, are the stem groups of modern stick and leaf insects, and all of them constitute the clade of Phasmatodea.

The superfamily is more likely related to the Stratiomyomorpha than to the Muscomorpha (including Nemestrinoidea). The components and structures of the ovipositor are re-illustrated. The results of our comparative study demonstrate that the ovipositor of Zhenia is similar in shape and detail to that of Rhagoletis pomonella (Walsh, 1867) (Tephritidae).

The membrane is transparent, veins are thickened and strongly sclerotized, and between C and SC2 is a conspicuous leathery lancet-shaped pterostigma. The wings are folded longitudinally back on the abdomen between the CuP and AA(1) veins in repose. The palaeobiology of Alienoptera is discussed based on the morphology of both known species.

Both specimens were studied with light- and micro-CT technology, allowing a detailed reconstruction of the posterior telopods and numerous other morphological characters. Based on these characters, the specimens can be securely placed in the megadiverse, mainly Asiatic genus Hyleoglomeris Verhoeff, 1910 as a new species, Hyleoglomeris groehni n. sp. The species H. groehni n. sp. is the oldest and only known fossil member of the Glomerida that is sufficiently described to allow for placement in a family or genus. The discovery of a fossil Hyleoglomeris in Baltic amber has biogeographic implications as the genus is now speciose in Asia, with the nearest relatives found in the Caucasus and some caves in Serbia and Greece. With the discovery of a fossil European Hyleoglomeris species, the cave Hyleoglomeris species are interpreted as relicts, surviving underground as living witnesses of a different time when Hyleoglomeris was still extant in Europe. Other cave Glomerida in Europe, as well as morphologically aberrant pill millipede species endemic to the Canary Islands, should be checked for potential placement in Hyleoglomeris.

Investigations of past ecosystems offer additional insights to help better understand the processes underlying biodiversity. The Cretaceous period is of special interest in this context, especially with respect to arthropods. During that period, representatives of many modern lineages appeared for the first time, while representatives of more ancient groups also co-occurred. At the same time, side branches of radiating groups with 'experimental morphologies' emerged that seemed to go extinct shortly afterwards. However, larval forms, with their morphological diversity, are largely neglected in such studies, but may provide important insights into morphological and ecological diversity and its changes in the past. Results We present here a new fossil insectan larva, a larval lacewing, in Cretaceous amber, exhibiting a rather unusual, 'experimental' morphology. The specimen possesses extremely large (in relation to body size) mandibulo-maxillary piercing stylets. Additionally, the labial palps are very long and are subdivided into numerous elements, overall appearing antenniform. In other aspects, the larva resembles many other neuropteran-type larvae. Conclusions We provide a comparison that includes quantitative aspects of different types of neuropteran larvae to emphasise the exceptionality of the new larva, and discuss its possible relationships to known lineages of Neuroptera; possible interpretations are closer relationships to Dilaridae or Osmylidae. In any case, several of the observed characters must have evolved convergently. With this new find, we expand the known morphological diversity of neuropterans in the Cretaceous fauna.","[Haug, Joachim T.; Haug, Carolin] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Bioctr, Grosshaderner Str 2, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany; [Haug, Joachim T.; Haug, Carolin] GeoBioctr LMU, Richard Wagner Str 10, D-80333 Munich, Germany","Haug, JT (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Bioctr, Grosshaderner Str 2, D-82152 Martinsried, Germany.; Haug, JT (corresponding author), GeoBioctr LMU, Richard Wagner Str 10, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",joachim.haug@palaeo-evo-devo.info,,,Volkswagen FoundationVolkswagen; LMUexcellent Junior Researcher Fund,The Volkswagen Foundation supports JTH with a Lichtenberg professorship.

Using inverted fluorescence and light microscopy for detailed analysis of microstructures, the inclusions were identified as primary larvae of the beetle family Ripiphoridae, subfamily Ripidiinae. While the structure of thoracic and abdominal segments including appendages corresponds well with the groundplan known in recent members of Ripidiinae, a curved prosternal ridge with prominent spines (each c. 5 mu m), the reduced condition of stemmata and antennae and the lack of sharp mandibles are unique features within the entire family, apparently apomorphies of the longipedes larvae. A sinuate prosternal edge with a dense row of spines (prosternoctenidium) might be homologous with 'head ctenidia' in some previously described miniaturized conicocephalate larvae, but further investigation is needed. The morphological differences between the head of longipedes larvae and extant Ripidiinae are interpreted as adaptations to different groups of hosts and life strategies. Palaeoethology of the longipedes larvae is briefly discussed. In addition, the systematic placement of conicocephalate larvae from Canadian, Myanmar and Russian Cretaceous ambers, already interpreted by various authors as primary instars within Coleopterida (assigned to either Strepsiptera or to the coleopteran Tenebrionoidea: Ripiphoridae), is discussed.","[Batelka, Jan; Prokop, Jakub] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, Vinicna 7, Prague 12843 2, Czech Republic; [Pohl, Hans; Beutel, Rolf G.] FSU Jena, Inst Zool & Evolut Forsch, Jena, Germany; [Bai, Ming] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, Beijing, Peoples R China","Prokop, J (corresponding author), Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, Vinicna 7, Prague 12843 2, Czech Republic.",jprokop@natur.cuni.cz,"Pohl, Hans/M-6873-2019; Prokop, Jakub/B-1432-2008","Prokop, Jakub/0000-0001-6996-7832; Pohl, Hans/0000-0002-7090-6612","European Regional Development FundEuropean Commission; state budget of the Czech Republic [CZ.1.05/4.1.00/16.0347]; Grant Agency of the Czech RepublicGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [18-03118S]; Institutional Research Support grant of the Charles University, Prague; Charles University Grant Agency (GAUK) [1546218]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31672345]; Research Equipment Development Project of Chinese Academy of Sciences [YZ201509]","JB and JP are much obliged to Arnold Staniczek and Karin Wolf-Schwenninger (both Staatliches Museum fur Naturkunde, Stuttgart, Germany) for loan of the amber piece with syninclusion of longipedes larvae from Myanmar under their care.

The species possesses a number of morphological traits that exclude it from all extant suborders, and Burmanopetalidea suborder nov. and Burmanopetalidae fam. nov. are here erected to accommodate it. The new suborder can be recognized by the following unique characters: pleurotergal setae absent; telson with a specific spatulate shape twice the size of the penultimate body ring; hypoproct devoid of setae; and eyes composed of five well-separated ommatidia. While the callipodidan habitus seems to have remained generally unchanged for at least 99 million years, pleurotergal and hypoproctal setation, as well as the complexity of eyes in ground-dwelling forms may have evolved recently in the order.

A data set of 70 morphological characters scored for 29 species of Mastigitae was analysed using maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference; both analyses recovered a sister relationship between dagger Archemastax and extant leptomastacines. However, in the former analysis Leptomastacini was recovered as sister to the remaining Mastigitae, while the latter indicated an origin of Leptomastacini from within Clidicini.

A dataset of 76 morphological characters scored for 33 recent species across the subfamilies Staphylininae and Paederinae was analysed using maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference methods. The many differing phylogenetic hypotheses for higher-level relationships in the large rove beetle subfamilies Staphylininae and Paederinae were summarized and their hitherto known fossil record was reviewed. Based on the analyses, the new extinct genus Vetatrecus gen.n. is described with two new species: V. adelfiae sp.n. and V. secretum sp.n. Both species share character states that easily distinguish them from all recent Othiini and demonstrate a missing morphological link between subfamilies Staphylininae and Paederinae. This is the first morphology-based evidence for the paraphyly of Staphylininae with respect to Paederinae, suggested earlier by two independent molecular-based phylogenies of recent taxa. Our newly discovered stem lineage of Othiini stresses the importance of fossils in phylogenetic analyses conducted with the aim of improving the natural classification of extant species. It also suggests that the definitions of Staphylininae and Paederinae, long-established family-group taxa, may have to be reconsidered.","[Kypke, Janina L.; Solodovnikov, Alexey; Zyla, Dagmara] Nat Hist Museum Denmark, Biosystemat Sect, Zool Museum, Univ Pk 15, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark; [Brunke, Adam] Agr & Agri Food Canada, Canadian Natl Collect Insects Arachnids & Nematod, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Yamamoto, Shuhei] Kyushu Univ Museum, Fukuoka, Fukuoka, Japan; [Yamamoto, Shuhei] Field Museum Nat Hist, Integrat Res Ctr, Chicago, IL 60605 USA","Kypke, JL (corresponding author), Nat Hist Museum Denmark, Biosystemat Sect, Zool Museum, Univ Pk 15, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.",j.kypke@snm.ku.dk,"Yamamoto, Shuhei/U-8247-2018; Solodovnikov, Alexey/A-2298-2012","Yamamoto, Shuhei/0000-0002-4162-8457; Zyla, Dagmara/0000-0003-4959-763X; Solodovnikov, Alexey/0000-0003-2031-849X; Kypke, Janina/0000-0003-2120-3133",Villum Foundation; European UnionEuropean Commission [642241],"We are very thankful to Anders Leth Damgaard (Copenhagen, Denmark) for providing one of the fossils, Yui Takahashi (University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan) for preparing the amber specimens used in this study, Aslak Kappel Hansen for some illustrations, and Arn Rytter Jensen for the digital artistic reconstruction of Vetatrecus secretum.

Alongside these findings, there are many taxa that can only be shown to be termites with no other phylogenetically informative data. These form a comb of 'grade groups' emerging in the Late Jurassic. The new amber specimens are described as two new species. Anisotermes xiai gen. et sp.n. is described from multiple castes and has symplesiomorphic characteristics: large body size, a broad pronotum, well-developed reticulated veins, and a large anal lobe of the hindwings. It shares wing features with the other new species, Mastotermes monostichus sp.n. Both new taxa are assigned to the Mastotermitidae, as they are shown to have synapomorphies that unite the family.

The sooty mould community is a distinctive trophic element of New Zealand forest ecosystems that is driven by plant-feeding sternorrhynchan Hemiptera. These produce honeydew, which supports fungal growth, which in turn supports numerous endemic invertebrates, including endemic New Zealand beetle families. Ancient New Zealand insect fossils are rare but a single fossil of a sooty mould cyclaxyrid was recently described from Cretaceous Burmese amber, a family that was previously known from two extant New Zealand species. Well-preserved fossils like this one are recasting Earth history, and, based on a wealth of additional specimens, we re-evaluate the taxonomy of Cretaceous cyclaxyrids and one Eocene species here transferred to Cyclaxyridae. Cyclaxyridae are highly tied to the sooty mould community and have now been discovered to occur in disparate biogeographic realms in deep time. Our discovery indicates that the family, and perhaps the sooty mould community in general, was widespread in Pangaea from at least the Cretaceous and survived as a relict in New Zealand. Persistence of a sooty mould ecosystem in New Zealand and fungal specialization may not necessarily be an evolutionary 'dead-end' for cyclaxyrids and other insects.","[Gimmel, Matthew L.] Santa Barbara Museum Nat Hist, Invertebrate Zool Dept, 2559 Puesta Sol Rd, Santa Barbara, CA 93105 USA; [Szawaryn, Karol] Polish Acad Sci, Museum & Inst Zool, Wilcza 64, PL-00679 Warsaw, Poland; [Cai, Chenyang] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Cai, Chenyang] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Leschen, Richard A.

The dominance of Aeshnidae is consistent with other Paleocene and Eocene fossil localities. Auroradraco eos is the only fossil Gomphidae in the roughly 66-million-year gap between occurrences in mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber and the early Oligocene of France. Ypshna appears close to Parabaissaeshna ejerslevense from the early Eocene Fur Formation of Denmark; this is not surprising given Holarctic intercontinental connections at this time and a growing list of insect taxa shared between the Okanagan Highlands and the Fur Formation.","[Archibald, S.

The fossil data is combined with the characters of the recent representatives of Cerophytidae to build a new phylogenetic hypothesis of their relationships. Twenty-three in-group taxa and three out-groups were included in a maximum parsimony cladistic analysis based on 32 adult characters. The resulting tree confirms the family Cerophytidae as a monophylum with two weakly supported clades, segregating most of the extinct Mesozoic and extant genera into separate clades. The new concept of the family Cerophytidae is presented to reconcile characters of the Mesozoic and recent taxa, without recognition of Aphytocerinae Kirejtshuk, 2013. Lebanophytum Kirejtshuk and Azar (=Lebanophytidae Kirejtshuk in Kirejtshuk and Azar, 2013), originally placed in Cerophytidae, is removed from Elateroidea and placed in the cucujoid family Cryptophagidae.

However, the origin and early evolution of the cockroach ootheca is poorly known, attributable to a lack of fossil evidence from the Mesozoic. Here, we report the earliest known cockroach fossil possessing an internally partitioned ootheca: Piniblattella yixianensis Gao, Shih & Ren sp. nov. is described from the mid Early Cretaceous Yixian Formation of China. The ootheca of this species measures 46-62% of its body length, contains 60-70 eggs, and exhibits the oviparity B reproduction mode, similar to that of the extant ectobiid and blattid cockroaches. In conjunction with several isolated ootheca specimens preserved in the mid-Cretaceous Myanmar amber (Burmite), we infer that the cockroach reproductive mode using the complete oothecate structure occurred during or before the mid Early Cretaceous. Maternal care associated with the oothecate condition in these Cretaceous cockroaches added a unique and major life-history trait, later resulting in true viviparity. This new life-history trait providing maternal protection and care may have been a key factor in the subsequent evolutionary diversification and ecological expansion of modern cockroach lineages.","[Gao, Taiping; Shih, Chungkun; Labandeira, Conrad C.; Liu, Xin; Ren, Dong] Capital Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China; [Shih, Chungkun; Labandeira, Conrad C.] Smithsonian Inst, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Dept Paleobiol, Washingto, DC 20013 USA; [Labandeira, Conrad C.] Univ Maryland, Dept Entomol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Labandeira, Conrad C.] Univ Maryland, BEES Program, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Wang, Zongqing; Che, Yanli] Southwest Univ, Coll Plant Protect, Inst Entomol, Chongqing 400716, Peoples R China; [Yin, Xiangchu] Chinese Acad Sci, Northwest Inst Plateau Biol, 23 Xinning Rd, Xining 810008, Qinghai, Peoples R China","Gao, TP; Ren, D (corresponding author), Capital Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China.",tpgao@cnu.edu.cn; rendong@mail.cnu.edu.cn,"Gao, Taiping/Z-3987-2019","Gao, Taiping/0000-0002-8118-8708","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31730087, 41688103, 31672323]; Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in UniversityProgram for Changjiang Scholars & Innovative Research Team in University (PCSIRT) [IRT-17R75]; Support Project of High-level Teachers in Beijing Municipal Universities in the Period of 13th Five-year Plan [IDHT20180518]; Young Elite Scientist Sponsorship Program by CAST (YESS); Natural Science Foundation of Beijing, ChinaBeijing Natural Science Foundation [5182004]; Science and Technology Development Program of Beijing Municipal Commission of Education [KM201610028009]","We are grateful to Dr Alexandr P.

Two other proctotrupomorph fossils from the Koonwarra Fossil Bed are confirmed to represent Proctotrupidae. Through the survey of Cretaceous Australian Proctotrupomorpha, which are preserved just in very few known fossils, the necessity of additional research on Australian Cretaceous Hymenoptera and continuing search for insect fossils in the Koonwarra Fossil Bed, as well as for additional research on known fossils and possible redescriptions is being emphasized.

The temporal distribution of Southeast Asian theropods ranges from the Late Jurassic to the mid-Cretaceous. All non-avian theropod faunas from Southeast Asia consist of non-maniraptoran tetanurans. They show similarity to Chinese plus Japanese theropods during the Early Cretaceous in broad systematic terms. During this time, megaraptorans can be found only in Japan, Australia, Brazil, and possibly Thailand, whereas tyrannosauroids can be found in China, Europe, possibly Brazil and Australia. Spinosaurids, carcharodontosaurians, and some coelurosaurs such as ornithomimosaurs were almost cosmopolitan.

With a multigene dataset as the basis for a comprehensive gekkotan phylogeny, model-based methods have recently been employed to estimate the number of unique derivations of the adhesive system and its role in lineage diversification. Evidence points to a single basal origin of the spinulate oberhautchen layer of the epidermis, which is a necessary precursor for the subsequent elaboration of a functional adhesive mechanism in geckos. However, multiple gains and losses are implicated for the elaborated setae that are necessary for adhesion via van der Waals forces. The well-supported phylogeny of gekkotans has demonstrated that convergence and parallelism in digital design are even more prevalent than previously believed. It also permits the reexamination of previously collected morphological data in an explicitly evolutionary context. Both time-calibrated trees and recently discovered amber fossils that preserve gecko toepads suggest that a fully-functional adhesive apparatus was not only present, but also represented by diverse architectures, by the mid-Cretaceous. Further characterization and phylogenetically-informed analyses of the other components of the adhesive system (muscles, tendons, blood sinuses, etc.) will permit a more comprehensive reconstruction of the evolutionary pathway(s) by which geckos have achieved their structural and taxonomic diversity. A phylogenetic perspective can meaningfully inform functional and performance studies of gecko adhesion and locomotion and can contribute to advances in bioinspired materials.","[Bauer, A.

In this study, we documented the characteristics of fossils hosted in the amber, and we present zircon U-Pb ages of tuff layers from the Kachin and Hkamti sites (i.e., the new mine). We also present a compilation of arthropod and echinoderm syn-inclusions from the mid-Cretaceous Hkamti amber of Myanmar, indicating a humid tropical or subtropical forest paleo-environment. Zircon analyses (n = 143) of four tuff samples that host the amber deposit in different pits yielded a weighted-mean age of 109.7 +/- 0.4 Ma. Zircon rare earth element data demonstrate the zircons are of igneous origin. Therefore, the age of the Cretaceous amber biota from Hkamti is ca. 110 Ma. This means that the Hkamti assemblage should be treated as distinct from other Burmese amber collections, as it represents a significantly older source within a different depositional environment. The commercial sources of Burmese amber are variable and encompass multiple mining regions, which makes maintaining distinctions between deposits important if their faunal contents are to be studied in a proper temporal or ecological context. The refined understanding of amber deposits in Myanmar highlights the importance of distinguishing sources, but it also offers an opportunity to study a series of deposits from similar to 110 to similar to 72 Ma, instead of just one snapshot of terrestrial ecology around similar to 99 Ma.","[Xing, Lida] China Univ Geosci, State Key Lab Biogeol & Environm Geol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Xing, Lida; Qiu, Liang] China Univ Geosci, Sch Earth Sci & Resources, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Qiu, Liang] Univ Nevada, Dept Geosci, Las Vegas, NV 89154 USA","Qiu, L (corresponding author), China Univ Geosci, Sch Earth Sci & Resources, State Key Lab Geol Proc & Mineral Resources, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China.",qiul@cugb.edu.cn,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41888101, 41790455, 41772008, 41702207]; National Geographic Society (USA)National Geographic Society [EC0768-15]","This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants 41888101, 41790455, 41772008, and 41702207), and National Geographic Society (USA; Grant EC0768-15).

A diagnosis and a key to the genera and species of Haidomyrmecinae are provided. The mouthparts and cranial features of these remarkable taxa display a series of morphological syndromes that likely relate to specialized prey capture.

Here we describe two new species in Coleoptera tentatively described in Kateretidae based on two syninclusions (co-occurrences of multiple individuals) from mid-Cretaceous Machin amber (Myanmar). Cretaretes minimus gen. et sp. nov. is described based on 41 fossil beetle specimens together in one piece of fossil resin and Eoceniretes antiquus sp. nov. is also described based on 41 fossil beetle specimens together in another piece of fossil resin from the same deposit. Eoceniretes Kirejtshuk and Nel, 2008 was first described from a fossil embedded in the lower Eocene Oise amber (France). This new species, Eoceniretes antiquus sp. nov., exhibits sexual dimorphism; males have a long and modified scapes. Although male mechanical modifications are usually understood to play a role in intrasexual competition, in this case the modified scapes is hypothesized to fulfill some function for sexual communication rather than for fighting. The syninclusions of many specimens from the same species demonstrate that this group of beetles, which today form large aggregations as larval and adult stages to feed on angiosperm flowers, had this aggregation behavior as early as the mid Cretaceous. Kachin Myanmar amber (98.79 +/- .62 Ma) was deposited during an intense diversification of angiosperms (also called Cretaceous Terrestrial Revolution), and so we postulate that Kateretidae were a possible pollinators for the basal angiosperms, an inference based upon their aggregative and pollination behavior in the extant species.

Herein, on the basis of an adult shore bug fossil trapped in a mid-Cretaceous Kachin amber piece from northern Myanmar, we describe a new genus and species Cretaleptus popovi gen. et sp. nov., attributed to Leptosaldinae. The new taxon differs from all known living and extinct leptosaldines by possessing a series of unique morphological traits: the head greatly porrect, antennae densely covered with short and slender setae but very long setae absent, with segment II slightly shorter than III and the latter slightly shorter than IV, the pro- and mesonotum tinged with longitudinal stripe in midline, hemelytra darkly pigmented with two distinct light stripes and two speckles, the corium and clavus with three rows of punctures respectively, and membrane with four closed cells. In this study, a key to all leptosaldine genera is also provided. Our find further confirms that this enigmatic leptopodomorph lineage was likely abundant and with high diversity in the late Mesozoic. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Its taxonomic affinities with the other fossil and living psyllipsocid genera are discussed. The attribution to the extant genus Psyllipsocus is based on the absence of any significant differences with this genus that could not correspond to a specific level. This situation is rare but not exceptional, as some other extant insect genera have already been recorded from the Burmese amber. It suggests a high morphological stability of the genus over time.

Their front legs are modified for digging and their back legs are adapted for swimming. The present paper describes two pygmy mole crickets: Ellipes dominicana n. sp. in Dominican amber and Cascogryllus lobiferus gen. et sp. n. in Burmese amber. The Dominican amber specimen is characterized by a narrow profemur and protibia, lack of armature on the protibia, absence of metatibial lamellae, 5 terminal apical/subapical spurs, all bearing a single claw, 2-segmented cerci and the paraproct bearing a pair of lobes. The Burmese amber specimen is characterized by 4 dactyls on the protibia, a well developed metatarsus, 2-segmented cerci, well-developed paraproctal processes and paired prosternal tubercles.

The new fossils provide evidence of an ancient origin of Protopselaphinae, a 'missing link' between the megadiverse Pselaphinae and other subfamilies in the Omaliine group.

Thyrsopteris cretacea is the first described mid-Cretaceous tree fern preserved in amber. It adds to the diversity previously ascribed to the Thyrsopteridaceae, which has been based on Eocene fossils, and it extends the fossil record of the family further back to the mid-Cretaceous. Most previous fossils of Thyrsopteridaceae have been from the Southern Hemisphere and are therefore considered Gondwanan. Thyrsopteris cretacea represents one of the few occurrences of the family in Laurasia. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we report a new mid-Cretaceous rhopalosomatid wasp, Cretolixon alatum Lohrmann, gen. et sp. nov., from Burmese (Kachin) amber. This new genus has a unique mixture of characters, some of which are only known from the recent brachypterous genus Olixon and others of which are known only from the recent macropterous genera. Thus, Cretolixon Lohrmann, gen. nov. not only provides further evidence for the monophyly of the family but also contributes evidence for the monophyly of the Rhopalosomatinae. Key characters of the family are discussed, and an updated checklist of the world genera and fossil species and occurrences of Rhopalosomatidae is provided.

Additionally, all legs carry a prominent lanceolate lobe on the third tarsomere. A similar structure is found, but organized differently, in Recent Orussidae and Stephanidae, serving as part of a vibration analyser. Although sharing some characters with families Karatavitidae, Orussidae and Paroryssidae, this new taxon cannot be assigned to any of these families.

Ptinidae is one of these groups. We describe herein Cretasernus spinosus gen. et sp. nov. (Coleoptera: Ptinidae) based on one fossil specimen, the only known specimen of this family from Kachin amber (mid-Cretaceous of Myanmar). The holotype was imaged using an X-ray micro-CT system to obtain high-quality 3D images to complement the structures visualized using optical microscopes. The new species shows two autapomorphic characters never described in any extant or extinct species in this family: a groove near the base of the 11th antennomere, which makes it appear as a much smaller additional antennomere, and transverse metacoxae touching at the middle. Phylogenetic analysis of the new species clearly supports this new genus as part of Anobiidae sensu stricto (i.e. excluding the spider beetles) despite antennae that are certainly more similar to those seen in the many of the spider beetles (except for the modified 11th antennomere). Some of the extant species in this family are wood-borers and the involvement of beetles in resin production during the Cretaceous is a hypothesis that is suggested often. However, some ideas against the involvement of Ptinidae in resin production within the mid-Cretaceous forests of Myanmar are discussed.","[Peris, David; Bao, Tong; Maehler, Bastian] Rheinische Friedrich Wilhelms Univ Bonn, Inst Geowissensch & Meteorol, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Bao, Tong] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Bao, Tong] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Palaeoenvironm, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Philips, T.

Ceratomyrmex planes sp. nov. is the second species formally known for the genus and obliges a revision of the generic diagnosis. It can be recognized by its smaller size, the straight and shorter club-like cephalic horn, and flattened eyes. Haidomyrmex davidbowiei sp. nov. has only two trigger hairs on the apex of a brief clypeal lobe dorsal to the setal patch, the first flagellomere distinctly longer than the second, amongst other characters. Dilobops bidentata gen. et sp. nov., is the only known ant with a bidentate projection on the frontal region. Its clypeus is posteriorly flanked by two projecting lobes. The possible relation of the cephalic and mandibular morphology with the feeding habits of Haidomyrmecinae is discussed. It is argued that not all species impaled prey with their mandibles and that honeydew collection could have formed a part of their diet. A key for identifying the species of Haidomyrmex is included.

The Mesozoic record of Melandryidae is sparse, with only three described species. A new genus and species, Longicrusa jaracimrmani gen. et sp. nov., is described here from the mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber (ca 99 Ma), representing the oldest false darkling beetle described to date. The modified maxillary palpi of L. jaracimrmani gen. et sp. nov. suggest that the species probably fed on fungi, and its prominent pectinate spurs indicate that the ability to jump had already developed in false darkling beetles by the mid-Cretaceous.

The family Odontoceridae contains 18 disparate genera, but there are no good diagnostic characters, which makes it difficult to place fossil taxa in this family. We here offer a revised diagnosis for the family, highlighting the lack of good diagnostic characters, and the need to use sets of characters to place (extinct) taxa in this family. On this taxonomic basis we describe two new species in the hitherto monotypic fossil genus Palaeopsilotreta Wichard & Wang, 2017 (Odontoceridae), Palaeopsilotreta burmanica sp. nov. and P. cretacea sp. nov., redescribe the type species based on additional information, and describe features of the female, based on two specimens, one of which is embedded adjacent to a male identified as P. xiai. Males of Palaeopsilotreta bear bipectinate antennae; the antennae of the females are simple and filiform. Similarly, bipectinate antennae are present in the third species we describe, Bipectinata orientalis gen. et sp. nov., which otherwise lacks the character combinations associated with the Odontoceridae, but clearly can be assigned to the family Calamoceratidae.","[Wichard, Wilfried] Univ Cologne, Inst Biol & Its Didact, Herbert Lewinstr 2, D-50931 Cologne, Germany; [Espeland, Marianne] Zool Res Museum Alexander Koenig, Arthropoda Dept, Adenauer Allee 160, D-53113 Bonn, Germany; [Mueller, Patrick] Friedhofstr 9, D-66894 Kashofen, Germany; [Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China","Espeland, M (corresponding author), Zool Res Museum Alexander Koenig, Arthropoda Dept, Adenauer Allee 160, D-53113 Bonn, Germany.",Wichard@uni-koeln.de; M.Espeland@leibniz-zfmk.de; pat14789@web.de; bowang@nigpas.ac.cn,,,"Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDA19050101, XDB26000000]; Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research [2019QZKK0706]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41622201, 41688103]","We are grateful to Alice Wells and Tobias Malm for their valuable comments on the manuscript.

Herein, we describe two new species from Burmese amber based on workers: Zigrasimecia hoelldobleri sp.n. and tProtozigrasimecia chauli gen.n. sp.n., which display a suite of plesiomorphies which are retained relative to dagger Zigrasimecia. We also illustrate and provide a descriptive sketch of an unplaced elate. With the new morphological characters from the two new taxa, we provide a key to the genera of the dagger Zigrasimeciini. The remarkable preservation of dagger Z. hoelldobleri sp.n. sheds considerable light on the functional morphology of zigrasimeciine mouthparts. Due to the ferocious function of the mouthparts of dagger Zigrasimecia and dagger Protozigrasinlecia, we colloquially dub these the iron maiden ants.

Well-preserved forewing venation indicates that the fossil belongs to Elcaninae; as such, this species is the latest known representative of this subfamily.

The absence of modified hind legs places the new taxon near the Mesozoic Liadopsyllidae (1 genus, 12 species) and Malmopsyllidae (4 genera, 4 species). The latter is defined by the presence of a pterostigma in the fore wing but is otherwise morphologically heterogeneous. Mirala has a pterostigma but shares also characters with Liadopsyllidae. It is concluded that Malmopsyllidae is polyphyletic and following synonymy is proposed: Liadopsyllidae = Malmopsyllidae syn. nov. Mirala differs from the other five Mesozoic psylloid genera in the straight, subparallel veins Rs, M and Cu-1a, the unforked vein M in the fore wing and the straight vein Cu-1b which is directed toward the wing base.

Burmese/Myanmar amber (or Burmite) from the middle Cretaceous preserves a diverse community of pseudoscorpions but these remain poorly documented, despite their exceptional preservation and potential to offer unique insights into evolutionary history. Here we describe a new genus and species of pseudoscorpion with a unique morphology of the chelicerae, Prionochthonius burmiticus gen. et sp. nov., from Burmese amber. Although some key characters remain obscure, the fossil can be confidently attributed to the basal pseudoscorpion family Chthoniidae, but it cannot be assigned to any extant or other fossil genus. Based on trichobothria patterns, it is most similar to extant genera that are found only in the Southern Hemisphere; findings that are in line with previous studies suggesting Gondwanan origins for at least some of the Burmese amber invertebrates. The fossil provides further evidence for a diverse community of litter- and soil-dwelling pseudoscorpions in the Late Cretaceous that comprises many extinct genera but represents many of the modern families. It also suggests that the diversification of chthoniid pseudoscorpions occurred well before the middle Cretaceous, and that the principle gestalt of its members has changed relatively little over time.","[Wriedt, Anna-Louisa; Kotthoff, Ulrich] Univ Hamburg, Ctr Nat Hist, Geol Paleontol Museum, Bundesstr 55, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Wriedt, Anna-Louisa; Kotthoff, Ulrich] Univ Hamburg, Inst Geol, Bundesstr 55, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Harvey, Mark S.] Western Australian Museum, Dept Terr Zool, Locked Bag 49, Welshpool Dc, WA 6986, Australia; [Harvey, Mark S.] Univ Western Australia, Sch Anim Biol, Crawley, WA 6009, Australia; [Hammel, Joerg U.] Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Inst Mat Res, Max Planck Str 1, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany; [Hammel, Joerg U.] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Spezielle Zool & Evolut Biol, Phylet Museum, Erbertstr 1, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Wriedt, Anna-Louisa; Harms, Danilo] Univ Hamburg, Ctr Nat Hist, Zool Museum, Martin Luther King Pl 3, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany","Kotthoff, U (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Ctr Nat Hist, Geol Paleontol Museum, Bundesstr 55, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.; Kotthoff, U (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Inst Geol, Bundesstr 55, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",ulrich.kotthoff@uni-hamburg.de,"Hammel, Jorg/D-6555-2011","Hammel, Jorg/0000-0002-6744-6811","German Science FoundationGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [HA 8785/5, KO 3944/10]",We thank Carsten Grohn for access to his collections.

Recent relaxed molecular clock based studies introduced the hypothesis that the diversity of these liverworts expanded during the Cretaceous Terrestrial Revolution (KTR) period around 125-80 Ma. Until now, the fossil record provides only insufficient support to elucidate this hypothesis. Here, we describe a new inclusion of Porellales within mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber as Frullania partita sp. nov. (Frullaniaceae). It is characterized by apically apiculate leaf lobes, helmet-shaped to campanulate water sacs situated in some distance to stem, lanceolate styli, and apically deeply bilobed underleaves carrying rhizoid bundles in their basal parts. This new discovery contributes our understandings for the diversity aspects of Frullaniaceae (Porellales) of Burmese amber inclusions. The bark fragments connected to the branch provide the evidence that the fossil was an epiphyte. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

They are provisionally not attributed to a precise subfamily. The female of Paleocytherea pouilloni has terminalia modified into a very wide chamber with acanthophorite spines on tergites 9 + 10 and a row of ventral setae evocating a specialized hair brush. These structures allowed digging into sand to lay eggs, and possibly would characterize a sand chamber similar to those of several extant Bombyliidae that use it to coat eggs with sand and attack ground-dwelling insects. Eggs are wrapped with sand, avoiding dessication and/or direct competition with more efficient parasitoids, including wasps. This discovery suggests a potential great antiquity for this behavior (e.g., potential competitors like angarosphecid wasps are recorded in Burmese amber). Potential bee fly hosts were antlions, pygmy mole crickets, and the earliest bees, also known in the Burmese amber. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

NOV.; PHYLOGENY; ODONATOPTERA; CHARACTERS; ZYGOPTERA; EPHEMEROPTERA; MORPHOLOGY,"The fossil record of dragonfly relatives (Odonatoptera) dates back to the Carboniferous, yet knowledge about these extinct animals is meagre. For most of the species little is known except for the characteristics of the wing venation. As a result, it is difficult to include fossil larvae in a (wing character based) phylogenetic tree as the wing venation is not visible in most of the larval instars. Two larval specimens from Cretaceous Burmese amber are in the focus of this study. The two specimens likely represent two subsequent early stage larval instars of the same individual Not only is this an exceptional case to study ontogenetic processes in fossils - the larval instars are morphologically completely different from all known larvae of Odonata with respect to the posterior abdominal region. Therefore, besides the difficulties regarding the phylogenetic interpretation and though all Burmese amber odonatans are known from adults only, a new species - Arcanodraco filitauda n. sp. - is formally described. Aside from likely representing a new species, the morphology of the posterior abdominal region is highly informative for reconstructing the character evolution within the lineage towards modern dragonflies and damselflies. A long median process in both of the fossils meets all criteria to be interpreted as a terminal filum (structure or derivative of tergite of abdominal segment 11, annulated in one of the specimens). Although the exact phylogenetic affinity of Arcamodnico filitauda n. sp. remains enigmatic, the presence of a larval terminal filum can be reconstructed for the ground pattern of Odonatoptera (including its direct stem lineage).","[Schaedel, Mario; Haug, Joachim T.] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Biol, Grosshaderner Str 2, Planegg Martinsried 82152, Germany; [Mueller, Patrick] Friedhofstr 9, Kashofen 66894, Germany; [Haug, Joachim T.] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, GeoBio Ctr, Richard Wagner Str 10, Munich 80333, Germany","Schadel, M (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Biol, Grosshaderner Str 2, Planegg Martinsried 82152, Germany.",mario.schaedel@palaeo-evo-devo.info; pat14789@web.de; joachim.haug@palaeo-evo-devo.info,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)German Research Foundation (DFG) [Ha 6300/3-2]; Volkswagen Foundation (Lichtenberg professorship),"We are grateful to Andre Nel (MNHN, Paris) and Ilaria Mazzini (associate editor) for their valuable comments which helped to improve the manuscript.

From its broad and flat habitus, the lack of a pronoto-elytral angle, the short and broad head, the short mesoventrite, and the lancet-shaped elongate prosternal process it resembles beetles belonging to the aquatic Dytiscoidea. The metacoxal plates are similar to those of Noteridae. However, pubescent antennal flagellomeres, an anisochaetous protibial antenna cleaner, transversely oriented metepimera, and metacoxae not reaching beyond the lateral margin of the metaventrite identify the fossil as an atypical species of Carabidae. Externally closed procoxal cavities, lacking procoxal rests of the mesoventrite, a narrow mesepimeron not reaching the mesocoxal cavity, and lobate metepimera indicate a placement in a clade comprising Harpalinae and Brachininae. This is supported by analyses of morphological data and a Hennigian character evaluation. The short and transverse head, the streamlined body without pronoto-elytral angle, and the secondarily elongated prosternal process suggest a placement as stem group member of the specialized Pseudomorphini. In contrast to species of the crown group of this lineage, a distinct submento-mental suture is present, ventral cephalic antennal grooves are missing, and the elytra are not truncated posteriorly. The fossil is the first record for Pseudomorphini and documents an origin of this specialized group of Carabidae at least dating back to the Cretaceous. A superficial similarity with the extant migadopine genus Stichonotus (e.g. broad and oval body, apically pointed prosternal process) is the result of convergence. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

According to the morphology of fossil forms this seems to have been the case already in the Early Cretaceous. While being predators, lacewing larvae are also food items for other organisms. Here we report two pieces of amber from Myanmar providing instances of such cases. In one amber piece several isolated stylets of lacewing larvae are preserved closely associated together. The most likely interpretation is that a predator preying on lacewing larvae has regurgitated or defecated these non-digestible pieces, yet the identity of the predator remains unclear. The other amber piece preserves a larva resembling modem day larvae of split-footed lacewings (Nymphidae). The larva has projections on its trunk, allowing it to wear a camouflaging cloak. In the head region, a mite (Acari) is attached to the larva; more precisely, the entire anterior body region of the mite is apparently inserted into the lacewing larva. The mite is smaller than the larva. It is known from the modern fauna that stage 1 larvae of Ascalaphidae can be attacked also by rather small predators, such as ants. The mite can therefore well be interpreted as a true predator instead of a parasite, especially considering the unusual mode of attachment. We briefly review interactions of lacewing larvae with other organisms represented in amber from Myanmar and add two new pieces to the puzzle of reconstructing the trophic interactions in the 100-million-year old amber forest.","[Hoernig, Marie; Kiesmuller, Christine] Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Zool Inst & Museum, Cytol & Evolutionary Biol, Soldmannstr 23, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany; [Mueller, Patrick] Friedhofstr 9, D-66894 Kashofen, Germany; [Haug, Carolin; Haug, Joachim] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen LMU, Bioctr, Grosshaderner Str 2, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany; [Haug, Carolin; Haug, Joachim] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, GeoBio Ctr, Richart Wagner Str 10, D-80333 Munich, Germany","Hornig, M (corresponding author), Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Zool Inst & Museum, Cytol & Evolutionary Biol, Soldmannstr 23, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany.",marie.hoernig@palaeo-evo-devo.info; pat14789@web.de; carolin.haug@palaeo-evo-devo.info,,"Kiesmuller, Christine/0000-0002-4961-6565",Volkswagen FoundationVolkswagen; Landesgraduiertenforderung Mecklenburg-Vorpommern,"We highly appreciate the effort of all people involved in providing open access, open source and low cost software.

Contrary to the only other rhopalosomatid described from burmite, dagger E. gorgyra, dagger E. lohrmanni has paired setae at the apices of various antennomeres, a synapomorphic condition of the Rhopalosomatidae. The new species contributes to the growing knowledge of Cenomanian biodiversity provided by Kachin burmite fossils from Myanmar. Future studies combining fossil and genomic data may reveal important morphological transformation series, which will be useful for revising the definition of the Vespoidea. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Various groups of fossil flies (Diptera) belong to the most abundant insects found in these fossil resins indicating that it was the Mesozoic when the early evolution and radiation of Diptera took place. Here we describe a remarkable fossil fly which combines characters of various other related flies from different families (both extant and fossil) in a very unusual way. This new genus is tentatively placed in the family Keroplatidae (the so called predaceous fungus gnats) pending and stimulating further research into the evolution of lower Diptera. A new fossil genus and species of Keroplatidae (Diptera, Bibionomorpha, Sciaroidea),Adamacrocera adamigen. et sp. nov., from the Upper Cretaceous Burmese amber is described and illustrated. Based on morphological evidence, it is placed in a new subfamily Adamacrocerinae subfam. nov. The new genus, as well as the subfamily, possesses the wing venation characteristic of the genera of some Sciaroidea incertae sedis, as well as that of the fossil families Archizelmiridae, Antefungivoridae and Mesosciophilidae, in combination with macrocerine-like habitus and male terminalia.","[Sevcik, Jan] Univ Ostrava, Fac Sci, Dept Biol & Ecol, Chittussiho 10, Ostrava 71000, Czech Republic; [Krzeminski, Wieslaw] Pedag Univ Krakow, Inst Biol, Podbrzezie 3, PL-31054 Krakow, Poland; [Skibinska, Kornelia] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Systemat & Evolut Anim, PL-31016 Krakow, Poland","Skibinska, K (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Inst Systemat & Evolut Anim, PL-31016 Krakow, Poland.",sevcikjan@hotmail.com; wieslawk4@gmail.com; yukisiak@gmail.com,,"Sevcik, Jan/0000-0001-7174-593X; Skibinska, Kornelia/0000-0002-5971-9373","National Science Centre of PolandNational Science Centre, Poland [UMO-2016/23/B/NZ8/00936]","This research was funded by the National Science Centre of Poland (grant number UMO-2016/23/B/NZ8/00936) and by the institutional support for the University of Ostrava provided by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic.",,43,2,5,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-4450,,INSECTS,Insects,SEP,2020,11,9,,,,,,,552,10.3390/insects11090552,,,9,Entomology,Entomology,OE1PZ,WOS:000580312700001,32825188,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,20/07/2021

Such larvae are also known from the fossil record, namely from fossils preserved in amber that largely resemble extant forms. Here we report a new fossil snake-fly larva from Burmese amber. The specimen is very unusual in the morphology of the antennae. In extant snake-fly larvae, the antenna is quite short and thin, often inconspicuous at first sight on normal habitus photographs. In the new fossil, the antenna is much longer than the head and also appears very robust, comparable to the thoracic appendages.

The discovery of a male with its genitalia partly exerted permits characterization of traits for the subfamily and provides further information on the uniqueness and affinities of the subfamily. In addition, the extended hind wing allows for a comparison between the folding mechanism between these fossils and their modern counterparts, demonstrating considerable conservatism in hind wing evolution among Dermaptera.","[Mao, Yue; Ren, Dong; Gao, Taiping] Capital Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, 105 Xisanhuanbeilu, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China; [Mao, Yue; Ren, Dong; Gao, Taiping] Capital Normal Univ, Acad Multidisciplinary Studies, 105 Xisanhuanbeilu, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China; [Engel, Michael S.] Univ Kansas, Nat Hist Museum, Div Entomol, 1501 Crestline Dr,Suite 140, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Engel, Michael S.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 1501 Crestline Dr,Suite 140, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Engel, Michael S.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, Cent Pk West & 79th St, New York, NY 10024 USA","Gao, TP (corresponding author), Capital Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, 105 Xisanhuanbeilu, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China.; Gao, TP (corresponding author), Capital Normal Univ, Acad Multidisciplinary Studies, 105 Xisanhuanbeilu, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China.",tpgao@cnu.edu.cn,"Engel, Michael S/C-5461-2012","Engel, Michael S/0000-0003-3067-077X","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31730087, 41688103, 31872277]; Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in UniversityProgram for Changjiang Scholars & Innovative Research Team in University (PCSIRT) [IRT-17R75]; Support Project of High-level Teachers in Beijing Municipal Universities in the Period of 13th Five-year Plan [IDHT20180518, CITTCD201704090]","We thank the Editorial Board of ZooKeys, and in particular, Dr. Yasen Mutafchiev and Dr. Jes Rust.

Evolutionary and palaeoecological interpretations using fossil beetles from Cretaceous ambers have become increasingly frequent in recent years, consequently leading to the discovery of an increasing number of new coleopteran species. By the end of 2019, a total of 364 new species from 81 families (some of them only known as fossils) were compiled, which are presented in this article. Beetles are currently among the most important pollinators of basal flowering plants and are thought to have been so since the origin of angiosperms. Some recent studies on specimens from Cretaceous amber support this idea, indicating the existence of a pre-existing guild of beetles that pollinated gymnosperms during the Early Cretaceous, with some groups moving from older gymnosperm to more recent angiosperm hosts. The effect of wood-boring beetle pests on resiniferous ancient forests has been widely cited in the literature, but there is no direct evidence in Cretaceous ambers. The current abundance of Lymexylidae beetles in Kachin amber (Myanmar) suggests that together with abiotic factors such as wildfires, storms, hurricanes and volcanos, fungal infections should also be thoroughly analysed as a cause of resin release in the past. In this review, we show how beetles from Cretaceous ambers are a useful tool for studying community and trophic structures as well as evolutionary implications for the ecosystem.

Silky lacewings show a distinct relic distribution, indicating that the group was more species-rich and diverse in the past. Silky lacewings have distinct larvae that resemble antlion larvae but differ from these in lacking teeth on their mouth parts, and in having a projecting labrum, which makes them long-nosed antlion larvae. These larvae are well known from Myanmar amber (about 100 mya) and Baltic amber (mostly 34-38 mya, possibly 23-48 mya), as well as from the extant fauna. We report and figure numerous additional specimens from both amber types and from ca. 100 mya old French Charentese amber, expanding the known record of well-illustrated extant and fossil specimens from 26 to 52 specimens. We compare the diversity of head shape among these larvae through time by outline analysis. Results indicate that morphological diversity was pronouncedly higher in the Cretaceous, even after sample size correction. Eocene representatives are more diverse than modern representatives, but less diverse than Cretaceous ones, in one shape aspect that explains most of the overall variation (55.7%). Eocene representatives are less diverse in another shape aspect that explains the second-most variation (26.9%), but this might reflect a lack of first larval stage specimens. There seems to be no strong correlation between size and shape. This type of analysis enables a test for the loss of diversity over time, based on morphological diversity as a proxy, without the requirement of identifying fossil larvae down to a narrow taxonomical range.","[Haug, Gideon T.; Haug, Carolin; Pazinato, Paula G.; Braig, Florian; Haug, Joachim T.] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Bioctr, Grosshaderner Str 2, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany; [Haug, Carolin; Haug, Joachim T.] LMU, GeoBio Ctr, Richard Wagner Str 10, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Perrichot, Vincent] Univ Rennes, Geosci Rennes, CNRS, UMR 6118, F-35000 Rennes, France; [Groehn, Carsten] Bunebuttler Weg 7, D-21509 Glinde, Germany; [Mueller, Patrick] Friedhofstr 9, D-66894 Kashofen, Germany","Haug, GT (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Bioctr, Grosshaderner Str 2, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany.",gideon.haug@palaeo-evo-devo.info; carolin.haug@palaeo-evo-devo.info; paula.pazinato@palaeo-evo-devo.info; florianbraig@t-online.de; florianbraig@t-online.de; vincent.perrichot@univ-rennes1.fr; pat14789@web.de; joachim.haug@palaeo-evo-devo.info,,"Perrichot, Vincent/0000-0002-7973-0430; Braig, Florian/0000-0003-0640-6012","Volkswagen FoundationVolkswagen; Lichtenberg Professorship; Capes/Doctoral Program (CAPES/DAAD/CNPQ) [15-2017, 88887.161379/2017-00]; LMUexcellent Junior Researcher Fund; LMU Munich; CNRS project ECLIPSE `Interactions climat/ecosystemes de l'Aptien au Paleocene'","This study heavily benefited from the help of various people and institutions; we thank them for their support.

An examination of fossil flowers in mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber and mid-Tertiary Dominican amber revealed a range of secretory tissues in the form of nectaries, glandular trichomes, eliaphores and osmophores. These tissues most certainly secreted liquids and volatiles to attract pollinators, just as they do in modern flowers. The morphological similarities of secretory tissues found on fossil flowers dating back to 100 mya to those of their present day descendants suggests that ancient and modern flowers may have produced similar essences, including those used in the production of today's perfumes and colognes.","[Poinar, George] Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA","Poinar, G (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Integrat Biol, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",poinarg@science.oregonstate.edu,,,,,,21,2,3,1,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",0891-2963,1029-2381,,HIST BIOL,Hist.

They have a fossil history extending to the Early Jurassic. During the past 180 Myr, the lineage has undergone significant evolutionary transformation, exhibiting an elevated diversity in morphology yet retaining the same overall ground plan. Although raptorial foreleg morphology and capture behaviour are well documented in extant insects, they are poorly known for premodern lineages, attributable to the scarcity and poor preservation of fossils. Here, we report two new genera and species of Mantispidae from mid-Cretaceous Myanmar (Burmese) amber. Both taxa have highly specialized raptorial forelegs and highlight modification of capture strategy in Cretaceous Mantispidae. The foreleg of both species has one major spine that is the same length as the foretibia on the ventral surface of the forefemur, which faces the foretibia with a row of robust setae. The two new amber mantid lacewings provide structural and functional indications that represent an extinct mode of capture strategy. The new findings reveal the presence of a geochronologically rapid diversification of Mantispidae during the Early Cretaceous, thereby illuminating the varied morphologies involved in prey-capture strategies integral to the early evolution of mantispids.","[Shi, Chaofan] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Earth Sci & Engn, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Geodynam & Geohazards, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Mineral Resources & Geol P, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China; [Yang, Qiang] Guangzhou Univ, Sch Life Sci, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China; [Shih, Chungkun; Labandeira, Conrad C.; Ren, Dong] Capital Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China; [Shih, Chungkun; Labandeira, Conrad C.; Ren, Dong] Capital Normal Univ, Acad Multidisciplinary Studies, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China; [Shih, Chungkun; Labandeira, Conrad C.] Smithsonian Inst, Dept Paleobiol, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Washington, DC 20013 USA; [Labandeira, Conrad C.] Univ Maryland, Dept Entomol, College Pk, MD 20742 USA; [Pang, Hong] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Ecol, Museum Biol, Key Lab Biodivers Dynam & Conservat,Guangdong Hig, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China","Shi, CF (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Earth Sci & Engn, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Geodynam & Geohazards, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Mineral Resources & Geol P, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China.; Yang, Q (corresponding author), Guangzhou Univ, Sch Life Sci, Guangzhou 510006, Peoples R China.",shichf5@mail.sysu.edu.cn; yq11_1984@126.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31501881, 31711530649, 41602014, 41688103]; Basal Research Fund of Sun Yat-sen University [17lgzd04]; Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in UniversityProgram for Changjiang Scholars & Innovative Research Team in University (PCSIRT) [IRT-17R75]; Support Project of High-level Teachers in Beijing Municipal Universities [IDHT20180518]; China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2016M592570]; Scientific Research Foundation of Guangzhou University [2900603133]; Basic Work Special Project of the National Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2013FY111500]","This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant nos. 31501881, 31711530649,41602014,41688103),BasalResearch Fund of Sun Yat-sen University (grant no. 17lgzd04), Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University (grant no.

(Hymenoptera: Dryinidae), is described from Burmese amber. Raptodryininae subfam. nov. represents one of the first fossil groups of chelate dryinids, documenting the fact that the evolution of chela still took place at the earliest Late Cretaceous. It is characterized by a very peculiar chela, composed of a proximal lobe of the fifth protarsomere opposable on a complex composed of the fifth protarsomere + arolium + both claws. This type of chela differs completely from the common chelae of extant and known fossil pincer wasps (composed of one enlarged claw opposable on a more or less strongly projecting fifth protarsomere). The chela of R. patrickmuelleri represents probably an early evolutionary stage of pincer wasps close to the basal Dryinidae, whose females were achelate. This discovery enabled us to outline the evolution of the chela of Dryinidae. In the evolution of pincer wasps, the oldest known fossil species, Aphelopus palaeophoenicius Olmi 2000, from Barremian Lebanese amber is of special importance as a basal exemplar. We had re-examined this species and attributed it to a new genus, Archaeodryinus gen. nov., and a new subfamily, Archaeodryininae subfam. nov., documenting the first known basal achelate pincer wasp. The emended data on the subfamily Aphelopinae suggest that this taxon is known only since the Miocene and that its females had secondarily lost their chelae. The discussion on biological features of Aphelopus that enabled parasitism on Typhlocybinae (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) is also given. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

(Diptera, Chironomidae, Podonominae) is described from mid-Cretaceous amber of northern Myanmar (similar to 100 Ma). The adult male of the new species/genus displays an interesting wing structure with a trace of the vein R2+3 (or R-3 alone), the character unique in the subfamily Podonominae. The wing squama with a process bearing a bunch of setae, the wing membrane covered with bi- or trifid spinulae-like microtrichia, the gonostylus with a collar-like ring and a pear-shaped distal part, the robust anal point and the extensive superior volsella are also characters defined as exclusive for Burmochlus. The antenna, thorax and several hypopygium structures found in male Burmochlus clearly resemble those known from Archaeochlus Brundin, here defined as the closest relative, as well as from Afrochlus Freeman and Austrochlus Cranston - both previously referenced to or derived from Archaeochlus, hence being postulated as close or sister taxa. In a view of several hypotheses on the time of divergence of the Podonominae and other related subfamilies, this is the oldest fossil record of a true Podonominae chironomid based on definition of male characters, and dated back to the mid-Cretaceous. Along with Furcobuchonomyia Baranov, Goral et Ross (Buchonomyiinae) and Myanmaro Gitka, Makarchenko, Pankowski et Zakrzewska (Orthocladiinae), Burmochlus is the third genus described from Burmese amber, and the first known Podonominae chironomid described from this deposit.

Incomplete knowledge of early feathers prevents a full understanding of how cylindrical rachises have evolved. Bizarre feathers with unusually wide and flattened rachises, known as rachis-dominated feathers (RDFs), have been observed in fossil nonavian and avian theropods. Newly discovered RDFs embedded in early Late Cretaceous Burmese ambers (about 99 million year ago) suggest the unusually wide and flattened rachises mainly consist of a dorsal cortex, lacking a medulla and a ventral cortex. Coupled with findings on extant feather morphogenesis, known fossil RDFs were categorized into three morphotypes based on their rachidial configurations. For each morphotype, potential developmental scenarios were depicted by referring to the rachidial development in chickens, and relative stiffness of each morphotype was estimated through functional simulations. The results suggest rachises of RDFs are developmentally equivalent to a variety of immature stages of cylindrical rachises. Similar rachidial morphotypes documented in extant penguins suggest that the RDFs are not unique to Mesozoic theropods, although they are likely to have evolved independently in extant penguins.","[Wang, Shuo; Hans, Harn I-Chen; Wu, Ping; Habib, Michael; Chuong, Cheng-Ming] Univ Southern Calif, Keck Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Los Angeles, CA 90033 USA; [Chang, Wei-Ling] China Med Univ Hosp, Integrat Stem Cell Ctr, Taichung 40447, Taiwan; [Zhang, Qiyue; Juan, Wen-Tau] Nankai Univ, Coll Life Sci, Tianjin 300071, Peoples R China; [Ma, Menglu; Yang, Rui] Capital Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Lab Vertebrate Evolut, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China; [Yang, Feng] Capital Normal Univ, Beijing Adv Innovat Ctr Imaging Technol, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China; [Zhuo, De] Beijing Xiachong Amber Museum, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Hans, Harn I-Chen] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Int Res Ctr Wound Repair & Regenerat, Tainan 70101, Taiwan; [Habib, Michael] Los Angeles Cty Museum Nat Hist, Los Angeles, CA 90007 USA; [Juan, Wen-Tau] China Med Univ, Dept Biomed Imaging & Radiol Sci, Taichung 40402, Taiwan","Wang, S (corresponding author), Univ Southern Calif, Keck Sch Med, Dept Pathol, Los Angeles, CA 90033 USA.",dinoshuo@gmail.com; cmchuong@med.usc.edu,"Wang, Shuo/AAX-8516-2020","Wang, Shuo/0000-0002-4076-0202","Human Frontier Sciences ProjectHuman Frontier Science Program [LT000728/2018]; National Institutes of Health, USAUnited States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USA [AR47364, AR60306]; China Medical University (CMU)/ Hospital in Taiwan [5351285884]; USC [5351285884]; Integrative Stem Cell Center, CMU/ Hospital in Taiwan; Taiwan Higher Education Sprout Project by the Ministry of Education in Taiwan; Ministry of Science and Technology in TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","We wish to thank the editors and two anonymous reviews for their constrictive critiques and advices improving the manuscript.

The amber borings are assigned to Teredolites clavatus Leymerie, 1842 and Apectoichnus longissimus (Kelly and Bromley, 1984), respectively. The presence of bioglyphs in a few borings suggests a mechanical production process, with pholadid bivalves such as Martesia preserved inside many of the samples representing the producer.

(mid-Cretaceous Myanmar amber) is the first extinct member of the suborder Myxophaga to reveal fine morphological structures, studied by synchrotron microtomography. A comprehensive phylogenetic analysis places it as a stem group in the extant relict family Lepiceridae. The fossil (along with previously known taxa) demonstrates that lepicerids with seven and five antennomeres co-existed during mid-Cretaceous, and only forms with extremely reduced, pentamerous antennae survived till present. The hitherto known fossil record of the enigmatic myxophagan beetles and phylogenetic reconstructions demonstrate that the reduction of antennomeres (i.e. antennal anarthrogenesis) from the ancestral 11 to seven took place as early as the Triassic, when the ancestral lineage of Myxophaga split into the 'lepicerid lineage' and an ancestor of all remaining families. Furthermore, the anarthrogenesis in the 'Lepicerus lineage' had been completed by the mid-Cretaceous. As all remaining morphological structures that define extant Lepicerus had differentiated by then, the extreme reduction of antennae to merely five antennomeres was the last major morphological transformation in their evolution. Morphological adaptations to protect body appendages (presumably against predators) also remained unchanged since the mid-Cretaceous, indicating a similar environmental pressures during this nearly 100 Ma-long period of lepicerid evolution.","[Jaloszynski, Pawel] Univ Wroclaw, Museum Nat Hist, Sienkiewicza 21, PL-50335 Wroclaw, Poland; [Luo, Xiao-Zhu; Beutel, Rolf G.] FSU Jena, Inst Zool & Evolutionsforsch, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Hammel, Joerg U.] DESY, Inst Mat Res, Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Outstn, Bldg 66,Notkestr 85, D-22607 Hamburg, Germany; [Yamamoto, Shuhei] Field Museum Nat Hist, Integrat Res Ctr, 1400 S Lake Shore Dr, Chicago, IL 60605 USA","Jaloszynski, P (corresponding author), Univ Wroclaw, Museum Nat Hist, Sienkiewicza 21, PL-50335 Wroclaw, Poland.",scydmaenus@yahoo.com,"Yamamoto, Shuhei/U-8247-2018; Hammel, Jorg/D-6555-2011","Yamamoto, Shuhei/0000-0002-4162-8457; Hammel, Jorg/0000-0002-6744-6811; Beutel, Rolf Georg/0000-0002-0433-7626",,,,48,0,1,3,8,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1477-2019,1478-0941,,J SYST PALAEONTOL,J.

The modem fauna yields several morphotypes of lacewing larvae, each closely associated with a distinct evolutionary lineage within the group of lacewings, Neuroptera. Back in the Cretaceous, about 100 million years ago, many of these larval forms had already evolved. Additionally, many larval forms seem to have been present that are now extinct. We report here a new form, which appears to be extinct now. This new larva has a prominent forward projecting labrum like larval forms of Nevrorthidae and Psychopsidae. It furthermore has (again similar to the latter two) curved venom-injecting stylets formed by mandibles and maxillae. We used quantitative outline analysis to compare the new larva to those of Nevrorthidae and Psychopsidae. The results of this analysis demonstrate that the new larva differs in all aspects of head capsule shape from all known larvae of Nevrorthidae. Its head shape is more similar to that of many larvae of Psychopsidae, yet also here the new larva differs recognisably in one principal component. Also qualitative differences clearly differentiate the new larva from already known ones. Hence, the new larva represents a new, so far unknown morphotype of lacewing larva. This finding adds to the growing 'zoo' of unusual lacewing larvae back in the Cretaceous, indicating that form diversity and ecological diversity of lacewings were much higher 100 million years ago.","[Haug, Joachim T.; Pazinato, Paula G.; Haug, Gideon T.; Haug, Carolin] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Biol, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany; [Haug, Joachim T.; Haug, Carolin] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, GeoBioctr, Richard Wagner Str 10, D-80333 Munich, Germany","Haug, JT (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Biol, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany.",joachim.haug@palaeo-evo-devo.info; paula.pazinato@palaeo-evo-devo.info; gideon.haug@palaeo-evo-devo.info; carolin.haug@palaeo-evo-devo.info,,,"Volkswagen FoundationVolkswagen; Capes/Doctoral Program (CAPES/DAAD/CNPQ) [88887.161379/2017-00, 15-2017]; LMUexcellent Junior Researcher Fund","The study was supported by the Volkswagen Foundation via a Lichtenberg professorship to JTH.

NOV COLEOPTERA; BURMESE AMBER; GEN.; CURCULIONIDAE; PHYLOGENY; FAMILY; TENEBRIONOIDEA; ELMIDAE; GEOLOGY; RESINS,"Beetles, the most successful group of invertebrates on Earth, have a worldwide distribution and an outstanding fossil record. In addition, they are well known as inclusions in fossil resin. In historical studies of fossil material, specimens were often named and described without placing the taxa in an ecological context. However, the research philosophy for fossil beetles has changed over the past few years. In this article, we summarize the palaeoecological interpretations of fossil beetles from Cretaceous ambers, which includes species from 69 families, most of which were described during the last 3 years. By analysing current habits of those families, we argue that saproxylicity was the most common feeding strategy for these fossil beetles. More specifically, fungivorous species appear to dominate. In contrast, we find only anecdotal evidence for the presence of wood-boring groups, and it is thus necessary to identify alternative abiotic or biotic processes that are responsible for the copious resin production at this time. Finally, the recent description of some beetles as gymnosperm pollinators during the Cretaceous lends more weight to the importance of amber studies in addressing the role of beetles in the evolution of pollination strategies.","[Peris, David; Rust, Jes] Rheinische Friedrich Wilhelms Univ Bonn, Inst Geowissensch & Meteorol, D-53115 Bonn, Germany","Peris, D (corresponding author), Rheinische Friedrich Wilhelms Univ Bonn, Inst Geowissensch & Meteorol, D-53115 Bonn, Germany.",daperce@gmail.com,,,"Alexander von Humboldt Foundation from GermanyAlexander von Humboldt Foundation; Ministry of Science, Innovations and Universities from Spain (project 'CRE', Spanish Agencia Estatal de Investigacion/Fondo Europeo de Desarrollo Regional) [UE CGL2017-84419]","We thank Xavier Delclos (Universitat de Barcelona, Spain) for help and suggestions with the first draft of this manuscript.

They are included in Corydioidea with Corydiidae. No fossil of this family was reported. Here we describe a stem member of Nocticolidae, Crenocticola burmanica gen. et sp. nov., from mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber. Its morphology appears plesiomorphic for Nocticolidae, and exhibits transitional form between crown Nocticolidae and Latindiinae (in Corydiidae). Placing Crenocticola in stem Nocticolidae is confirmed by a preliminary morphological phylogeny based on 28 non-genital characters. We use Crenocticola and published fossils to calibrate dating analyses of Corydioidea under autocorrelated TK02 relaxed clock model in MrBayes, and the analyses in turn test the power of Crenocticola as a node calibration. The dataset comprises published DNA (12S, 16S, 18S and 28S) of 19 ingroup taxa of Corydioidea, and eight outgroup taxa including termites. As a result, Crenocticola is too young to be an effective calibration. It is suppressed by the oldest fossil of termites, which may also be crucial in previous studies provided that unjustified fossil calibrations (e.g. 'roachoids') are excluded. We compare two approaches to applying fossil calibrations: 1) in-analytical calibration, i.e. incorporating the fossil age in prior settings, and 2) post-analytical calibration, i.e. adjusting the fixed prior so that the estimated age does not conflict with the fossil age. In-analytical calibration may underestimate the age, whilst post-analytical calibration yields better estimates. Our dating analyses suggest that crown Corydioidea likely originated in the Late Triassic or Early Jurassic. Questionable genera in Nocticolidae are briefly discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Baissopteridae are one of the two major lineages from the Mesozoic, but with a poorly known evolutionary history. Here, we report the first fossil record of Baissopteridae from the mid-Cretaceous of Myanmar, represented by a diverse assemblage including 10 new species in six genera:Allobaissoptera oligophlebiagen. et sp. nov.,Baissoptera burmanasp. nov.,B. maculatasp. nov.,B. monopodasp. nov.,B. pankowskiorumsp. nov.,B. wangisp. nov.,Burmobiassoptera jiaxiaoaegen. et sp. nov.,Electrobaissoptera burmanicagen. et sp. nov.,Rhynchobaissoptera huigen. et sp. nov., andStenobaissoptera xiaigen. et sp. nov. The new Cretaceous baissopterids provide significant morphological evidence in favor of the monophyly of this family. The morphological diversity in these Cretaceous baissopterids, particularly with some specialized and unique characters, highlights the early radiation of snakeflies formed in the complex tropical forest ecosystem of the mid-Cretaceous.","[Lu, Xiumei; Liu, Xingyue] China Agr Univ, Dept Entomol, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Lu, Xiumei] Shanghai Acad Agr Sci, Inst Ecol & Environm Protect, Shanghai 201403, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Weiwei] Three Gorges Entomol Museum, POB 4680, Chongqing 400015, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Engel, Michael S.] Nat Hist Museum, Div Entomol, 1501 Crestline Dr Suite 140, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Engel, Michael S.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 1501 Crestline Dr Suite 140, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Engel, Michael S.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, Cent Pk West & 79th St, New York, NY 10024 USA","Liu, XY (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Dept Entomol, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",xingyue_liu@yahoo.com,"Engel, Michael S/C-5461-2012; Liu, Xingyue/A-3019-2013","Engel, Michael S/0000-0003-3067-077X; Liu, Xingyue/0000-0002-9168-0659; Lu, Xiumei/0000-0002-3494-7871","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31672322, 31900348, 31972871, 41572010, 41622201, 41688103]; Shanghai Sailing Program [19YF1443000]; Changjiang Scholars Program (2018); Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB26000000]","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 31672322, 31900348, 31972871, 41572010, 41622201, 41688103), the Shanghai Sailing Program (19YF1443000), the Changjiang Scholars Program (2018) and the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDB26000000).",,54,0,1,2,6,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",1439-6092,1618-1077,,ORG DIVERS EVOL,Org.

A new specimen of an unnamed species of dagger Nuegua Yin et al. is recorded from the same deposit and illustrated for comparative purposes. dagger Loeblitoides is morphologically close to dagger Pangusyndicus, but has more plesiomorphic antennae, with the antennomere 11 distinctly smaller than 10, but fully demarcated by a constriction (antennomere 10 is not subcylindrical as in dagger Pangusyndicus, but fusiform). dagger Pangusyndicus longirostris, in turn, is unusual in having an elongated pre-ocular region of the head, resembling the condition known so far only in dagger Nuegua. Morphological affinities between these genera strongly suggest their close relationships. The previously postulated hypothesis of a close relationship between dagger Pangusyndicus and the extant Syndicus (and its closest relatives) is discussed as poorly supported, as these taxa, despite having similar antennal structure, differ in many important characters. In order to verify this issue, much dense taxon sampling (i.e., inclusion of at least most of extant genera and subgenera of Glandulariini) is required, as this is the largest and taxonomically most challenging tribe of Scydmaeninae, with still largely unknown relationships between extant taxa.

Sexual reproduction involving giant sperm, shared by three superfamilies of living ostracod crustaceans, is among the most fascinating behaviours. However, the origin and evolution of this reproductive mechanism has remained largely unexplored because fossil preservation of such features is extremely rare. Here, we report exceptionally preserved ostracods with soft parts (appendages and reproductive organs) in a single piece of mid-Cretaceous Kachin amber (approximately 100 Myr old). The ostracod assemblage is composed of 39 individuals. Thirty-one individuals belong to a new species and genus,Myanmarcypris huigen. et sp. nov., exhibiting an ontogenetic sequence from juveniles to adults (male and female). Seven individuals are assigned toThalassocypriasp. (Cypridoidea, Candonidae, Paracypridinae) and one toSanyuaniasp. (Cytheroidea, Loxoconchidae). Our micro-CT reconstruction provides direct evidence of the male clasper, sperm pumps (Zenker organs), hemipenes, eggs and female seminal receptacles with giant sperm. Our results reveal that the reproduction behavioural repertoire, which is associated with considerable morphological adaptations, has remained unchanged over at least 100 million years-a paramount example of evolutionary stasis. These results also double the age of the oldest unequivocal fossil animal sperm.

The fossil subfamily Propreocorinae Popov, Dolling & Whalley, 1994, recently excluded from Ochteridae by other authors, is formally raised to family rank as Propreocoridae stat. nov. The fossil genus Meropachys Popov, 1986 is found to be a junior homonym of Meropachys Burmeister, 1835 (Hemiptera: Heteroptera: Coreidae) and is replaced by a new substitute name, Yuripachys nom. nov., resulting in one new combination: Yuripachys dubius (Popov, 1986) comb. nov.

The name Ochterus perbosci (Guerin-Meneville, 1843), an incorrect subsequent spelling of O. perboscii in prevailing usage, is fixed according to Article 33.3.1 of the ICZN (1999). The spelling of Angulochterus quadrimaculatus Yao, Zhang & Ren, 2011 is corrected according to Article 32.5.1 of ICZN (1999). The original publication of Ochterus barberi Schell, 1943, O. bidentatus Schell, 1943, O. hungerfordi Schell, 1943, and O. parvus Schell, 1943 is clarified. The name bearing types of Ochterus barberi, O. bidentatus, O. hungerfordi, O. parvus, O. perbosci, and Pelogonus splendidulus Montandon, 1898 (= Ocyochterus victor (Bolivar, 1879)) are considered as lectotypes. The family Ochteridae currently includes 3 recent genera and 88 described species group taxa (84 species and 4 subspecies): Megochterus Jaczewski, 1934 (2 species from Australia), Ochterus (80 species and 4 subspecies distributed worldwide), and Ocyochterus Drake & Gomez-Menor, 1954 (2 species from NW South America). The fossil record of Ochteridae currently includes 4 genera and 5 species: Angulochterus Yao, Zhang & Ren, 2011 (1 species from Early Cretaceous of China), Floricaudus Yao, Ren & Shih, 2011 (1 species from Early Cretaceous of China), Pristinochterus Yao, Cai & Ren, 2007 (2 species from Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous of China), and Riegerochterus Popov & Heiss, 2014 (1 species from Miocene Dominican amber). In addition the fossil genus Yuripachys (1 species from Early Creatceous of Mongolia) is classified as Ochteridae incertae sedis, Propreocoris Popov, Dolling & Whalley, 1994 (1 species from Early Jurassic of England) as common ancestor of Ochteridae and Gelastocoridae in its own family Propreocoridae, and Grimaldinia Popov & Heiss, 2014 (1 species from Burmese Amber) and Heterochterus Evans, 1971 (1 species based on an isolated wing, Late Triassic of Australia) as Ochteroidea incertae sedis.

Here, we report the discovery of a highly diverse palaeofauna of mantidflies from the mid-Cretaceous (lowermost Cenomanian) of Myanmar. The raptorial forelegs of these mantidflies possess highly divergent morphological modifications, some of which are unknown among modern mantidflies, e.g. the presence of forked basal profemoral spines or even the complete loss of foreleg spine-like structures. A phylogenetic analysis of Mantispidae reveals a pattern of raptorial foreleg evolution across the family. The high species diversity and disparate foreleg characters might have been driven by diverse niches of predator-prey interplay in the complex tropical forest ecosystem of the mid-Cretaceous.","[Lu, Xiumei; Liu, Xingyue] China Agr Univ, Dept Entomol, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Lu, Xiumei] Shanghai Acad Agr Sci, Inst Ecol & Environm Protect, Shanghai 201403, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Weiwei] Three Gorges Entomol Museum, POB 4680, Chongqing 400015, Peoples R China; [Ohl, Michael] Museum Naturkunde, Dept Biodivers Discovery, Invalidenstr 43, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Engel, Michael S.] Univ Kansas, Div Entomol, Nat Hist Museum, 1501 Crestline Dr Suite 140, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Engel, Michael S.] Univ Kansas, Dept Ecol & Evolutionary Biol, 1501 Crestline Dr Suite 140, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Engel, Michael S.] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Div Invertebrate Zool, Cent Pk West & 79th St, New York, NY 10024 USA","Liu, XY (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Dept Entomol, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",xingyue_liu@yahoo.com,"Liu, Xingyue/A-3019-2013; Engel, Michael S/C-5461-2012","Liu, Xingyue/0000-0002-9168-0659; Engel, Michael S/0000-0003-3067-077X; Lu, Xiumei/0000-0002-3494-7871","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31972871, 31900348, 31672322, 41688103]; Changjiang Scholars Program (2018); Shanghai Sailing Program [19YF1443000]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB26000000]","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant nos. 31972871, 31900348, 31672322 and 41688103), the Changjiang Scholars Program (2018), the Shanghai Sailing Program (grant no. 19YF1443000) and the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (grant no.

Maculaferrum blaisi is part of a new collection assembled during recent fieldwork in the Redmond Formation, Labrador, Canada, near Schefferville. It consists in a single isolated forewing whose venational characters allow a classification to Tettigarctinae at the subfamily level. Classification at a higher level remains uncertain since it displays a combination of characters supposedly unique to tribes Protabanini, Meunierini, and Tettigarctini. Thus, this discovery adds credence to suggestions of a revision of the definitions of these tribes since they seem to be based on many convergent or plesiomorphic characters. Remnants of a spotted pattern on the wing membrane and probable setae along some veins are also preserved. Observations of the holotype's fine anatomical characters have been facilitated by the use of Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI), an emerging method for the visualization of compression and impression fossils. Considering that the estimated age of the Redmond Formation is the Cenomanian (Late Cretaceous), the discovery of Al blaisi contributes to a very recent expansion of the tettigarctid fossil record that fills a gap between Early Cretaceous and Cenozoic genera. It suggests that hairy cicadas maintained a global distribution and thrived in a variety of climate regimes well into the Late Cretaceous, and that their competitive exclusion by singing cicadas occurred definitely closer to the end of the Cretaceous, or even during the Cenozoic. This discovery is only the start of a thorough description of the recently expanded entomofauna in the Cretaceous of Labrador.","[Demers-Potvin, Alexandre, V; Larsson, Hans C.

There has been minimal molecular research on the family and as a result little understanding of the evolutionary relationships within the group. We present the first molecular phylogeny focused on Gasteruptiidae, generated using three molecular fragments (mitochondrial C01 and nuclear markers EF1- a and 28s) and estimate the divergence times of Evanioidea based on three secondary calibration points. The analyses included 142 specimens of Gasteruptiidae and 5 outgroup taxa from Aulacidae and Evaniidae. The monophyly of the Gasteruptiidae and its subfamilies Gasteruptiinae (Gasteruption) and Hyptiogastrinae (Hyptiogaster and Pseudofoenus) are confirmed. Our results indicate that Evanioidea diverged during the late Jurassic at 151.3 (171.99-136.15) Ma with Evaniidae during the early Cretaceous at 137.33 (140.86-133.67) Ma, and Gasteruptiidae during the Palaeocene at 60.23 ( 83.78-40.02) Ma. The crown age of Hyptiogastrinae was estimated to be during the mid-Eocene 40.72 (60.9-22.57) Ma and for Gasteruption during the early Eocene at 47.46 (64.7-31.75) Ma, which corresponded to their host divergence ages.

The ancestral elytral length of the family and of this subfamily have long been debated. We present a phylogenetic analysis of Omaliinae based on partial mitochondrial COI (1488 bp), COII (366 bp), 12S rDNA (353 bp), nuclear 18S rDNA (1814 bp), 28S rDNA (876 bp) and CAD (869 bp) data. In all, 51 species in 31 genera and four outgroup species were included. The concatenated sequences were analysed by both parsimony- and model-based (Bayesian and maximum likelihood) methods. The subfamily Omaliinae was not supported as a monophyletic group. The model-based analyses (Bayesian and maximum likelihood trees) showed Empelinae nested within Omaliinae (excluding Corneolabiini), whereas parsimony analysis found all three putative ingroup subfamilies, Empelinae, Glypholomatinae and Microsilphinae, grouped within Omaliinae. Within the Omaliinae, the tribes Coryphiini and Eusphalerini were each supported as monophyletic, whereas Anthophagini and Omaliini were each nonmonophyletic. We hypothesize that there have been at least four independent origins of long elytra from short elytra in the omaliine lineage.","[Kim, Tae-Kyu] Natl Res Inst Hlth, Div Med Entomol, Cheongju, South Korea; [Song, Jeong-Hun; Ahn, Kee-Jeong] Chungnam Natl Univ, Dept Biol, Daejeon 34134, South Korea; [Thayer, Margaret K.] Field Museum Nat Hist, Integrat Res Ctr, Chicago, IL 60605 USA; [Song, Jeong-Hun] Rural Dev Adm, Natl Inst Agr Sci, Dept Agr Biol, Ind Insect Div, Wonju 55365, South Korea","Ahn, KJ (corresponding author), Chungnam Natl Univ, Dept Biol, Daejeon 34134, South Korea.",kjahn@cnu.ac.kr,,"Thayer, Margaret/0000-0003-0061-9981",,,,75,6,7,1,19,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-6970,1365-3113,,SYST ENTOMOL,Syst.

Herein, an extensive taxonomic review of Procercopidae is presented and some new fossils are reported from the Lower Cretaceous Yixian Formation of NE China. As a result, Chengdecercopis Hong, 1983 is transferred from Procercopidae to Sinoalidae; Procercopis longipennis Becker-Migdisova, 1962 and P shawanensis Zhang, Wang and Zhang, 2003 are transferred to Procercopina Martynov, 1937, resulting in Procercopina longipennis (Becker-Migdisova, 1962), comb. n. and P shawanensis (Zhang, Wang and Zhang, 2003), comb. n.; Luanpingia senjituensis Hong, 1984 is transferred to Stellularis Chen, Yao and Ren, 2015, leading to Stellulari senjituensis (Hong, 1984), comb. n.; Anthoscytina macula Hu, Yao and Ren, 2014 is transferred to Sinocercopis Hong, 1982, and Sunoscytinopteris (Scytinopteridae) and Cathaycixius (Cixiidae) are treated as junior homonym names of Sinocercopis, leading to Sinocercopis macula (Hu, Yao and Ren, 2014), comb. n., S lushangfenensis (Hong, 1984), comb. n., S pustulosis (Ren, 1995), comb. n., and S trinervis (Ren, 1995), comb. n. Additionally, two new species are erected: Stellularis bineuris Chen and Wang, sp. n. and S minutus Chen and Wang, sp. n. Our cladistic analysis based on wing (tegmen and hind wing) characteristics recovers the high-level relationships within Cercopoidea: Sinoalidae + (Procercopidae + (Cercopionidae + modern cercopoids)). Within the family Procercopidae, the cladistic analysis reveals that the Middle to Late Jurassic Titanocercopis and Jurocercopis and the Cretaceous Cretocercopis occupy the basal position, and a gradual change in wing venation can be recognized from the Early Jurassic Procercopis and Procercopina to the Jurassic Anthoscytina, and then to the Cretaceous Stellularis and Sinocercopis. The two Cretaceous genera, sharing wing traits with extant cercopoids, likely represent transitional forms between Procercopidae and recent Cercopoidea; however, they are very similar to their Jurassic relatives in body structures, suggesting it is applicable to attribute them to Procercopidae. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that the extinction of Procercopidae and the origin and early diversification of modern Cercopoidea approximately coincided with the rise and explosive radiation of angiosperms in the late Early Cretaceous and onwards.","[Chen, Jun; Zheng, Yan; Zhang, Junqiang; An, Baizheng; Wang, Xiaoli] Linyi Univ, Inst Geol & Paleontol, Linyi, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Chen, Jun; Wang, Bo; Zheng, Yan; Jiang, Hui; Zhang, Haichun] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Chen, Jun; Wang, Bo; Zheng, Yan; Jiang, Hui; Zhang, Haichun] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Zool Systemat & Evolut, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Hui] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Tian] China Univ Geosci, State Key Lab Biogeol & Environm Geol, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Bozdogan, Hakan] Ahi Evran Univ, Tech Vocat Sch Kirsehir, Dept Herbal & Anim Prod, Kirsehir, Turkey","Chen, J; Zhang, HC (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.; Chen, J; Zhang, HC (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",rubiscada@sina.com; bowang@nigpas.ac.cn; zhengyan536@163.com; huijiang@nigpas.ac.cn; jiangtian@cugb.edu.cn; hakan.bozdogan@ahievran.edu.tr; zhangjunqiang@lyu.edu.cn; an_baizheng@126.com; wangxiaoli@lyu.edu.cn; hczhang@nigpas.ac.cn,"Xiaoli, Wang/H-1079-2014; BOZDOGAN, HAKAN/K-1400-2018","BOZDOGAN, HAKAN/0000-0002-6836-4383","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41502007, 41472023, 41702012, 41572010, 41622201, 41688103]; State Key Laboratory of Palaeobiology and Stratigraphy (Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, CAS)Chinese Academy of Sciences [183105]; Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB26000000]","The study was funded by National Natural Science Foundation of China (41502007; 41472023; 41702012; 41572010; 41622201; 41688103); State Key Laboratory of Palaeobiology and Stratigraphy (Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, CAS) (No. 183105); and Strategic Priority Research Program (B) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDB26000000).",,77,5,7,1,8,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0947-5745,1439-0469,,J ZOOL SYST EVOL RES,J.

Here an analysis is presented of the phylogenetic position of Leehermania prorova, the Late Triassic compressed fossil which was described and hitherto widely used as the oldest representative of Staphylinidae (rove beetles) in the suborder Polyphaga. By contrast with the intuitive character assessment made in the original description, a phylogenetic analysis of Leehermania is performed using an extensive morphological matrix of extant Coleoptera provided by the Beetle Tree of Life project, constrained in view of the latest relevant molecular phylogenies. As a result, Leehermania is identified as an extinct lineage within the beetle suborder Myxophaga, closest to the modern family Hydroscaphidae. Excluding Leehermania from Staphylinidae and placing it in Myxophaga amends erroneous assumptions about early diversification of rove beetles and enhances our views of the evolutionary history of Coleoptera.","[Fikacek, Martin] Natl Museum, Dept Zool, Prague 9, Czech Republic; [Fikacek, Martin] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, Prague 2, Czech Republic; [Beutel, Rolf G.] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Zool & Evolut Forsch, Jena, Germany; [Cai, Chenyang] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Cai, Chenyang] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Cai, Chenyang] Univ Bristol, Sch Earth Sci, Bristol, Avon, England; [Lawrence, John F.; Slipinski, Adam] Australian Natl Insect Collect, Canberra, ACT, Australia; [Newton, Alfred F.; Thayer, Margaret K.; Yamamoto, Shuhei] Field Museum Nat Hist, Integrat Res Ctr, Chicago, IL 60605 USA; [Solodovnikov, Alexey] Zool Museum, Nat Hist Museum Denmark, Copenhagen, Denmark","Fikacek, M (corresponding author), Natl Museum, Dept Entomol, Cirkusova 1740, Prague 19100 9, Czech Republic.",mfikacek@gmail.com,"Slipinski, Adam/AAZ-2485-2020; Slipinski, Stanislaw Adam/B-4293-2009; Yamamoto, Shuhei/U-8247-2018","Slipinski, Adam/0000-0002-1216-8068; Yamamoto, Shuhei/0000-0002-4162-8457; Thayer, Margaret/0000-0003-0061-9981","Ministry of Culture of the Czech Republic [DKRVO 2019-2023/5.I.a, 00023272]; Charles University Research Centre program [204069]; Ministry of Science and Technology [2016YFC0600406, 2015FY310100]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB26000000]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41730317]; Bureau of Geological Survey of China; National Committee of Stratigraphy of China [DD20160120-04]; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Overseas Research FellowshipMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [29-212]","This project was funded by: the Ministry of Culture of the Czech Republic (DKRVO 2019-2023/5.I.a, National Museum, 00023272) and by Charles University Research Centre program No. 204069 (MF); Ministry of Science and Technology (2016YFC0600406, 2015FY310100) and the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDB26000000) (CAS); the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41730317) and the Bureau of Geological Survey of China and the National Committee of Stratigraphy of China (DD20160120-04) (CC); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) Overseas Research Fellowship (29-212) (SY).",,68,14,15,1,10,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0307-6970,1365-3113,,SYST ENTOMOL,Syst.

This study reviewed the odonatans in lowermost Cenomanian Kachin amber and commented 11 odonatans, which were previously placed in the family level. Until now, over 350 odonatans have been found in Kachin amber, including 38 species of three extant suborders, and representing the most diverse and abundant dragonfly assemblage in amber inclusions. The dominated odonatans include the damselflies Burmahemiphlebia zhangi and Mesomegaloprepus magnificus, and the damsel-dragonfly Burmaphlebia reifi, accounting for ca. 79% of all odonatans. The Kachin odonatans include the earliest records of the damselfly Perilestidae, Platycnemididae and Platystictidae, and the youngest records of the true dragonfly Araripegomphidae and Stenophlebiidae, contributing to exploring the origination and evolution of these families. Hemiphlebiidae is the dominant family in Kachin amber, represented by the species Burmahemiphlebia zhangi with ca. 160 species been recorded. It is surprising that the hemiphlebiid damselfly is abundant, but the diversity is very low with only two species been previously reported. Herein, a new hemiphlebiid damselfly, Kachinhemiphlebia lini gen. et sp. nov., is described by the unique characters: Arc slightly distal of Ax2 in both foreand hindwings; and a well-defined AA ending on posterior wing margin below Ax2. This is the second genus of the Hemiphlebiidae in Kachin amber. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Earliest fossils of Frullaniaceae are known from mid-Cretaceous Burmese and Alaskan ambers. So far, evidence for four or five fossil species have been recovered in these ambers. The steady search for new fossils is important, since many liverwort fossils lack important characters and sometimes only the investigation of numerous specimens can provide all relevant characters. Based on two newly discovered and exquisitely preserved gametophytes from mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber, we provide a detailed investigation and re-appraisal of two previously described species of Frullaniaceae, namely Frullania baerlocheri and Protofrullania cornigera. The new discovery of a complete gametophyte of F. baerlocheri with both vegetative and fertile parts enables an emended morphological description, and demonstrates that F. baerlocheri and F. pinnata are conspecific. A new specimen of P. cornigera provides additional information concerning leaf lobule, stylus and leaf cells. The fossil record and phylogenetic analysis of the liverworts recovered in mid-Cretaceous Burmese and Alaskan amber clearly show that Frullaniaceae have already accumulated some notable diversity in the Cretaceous, including the extant genus Frullania with three species and the extinct monotypic genus Protofrullania from mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber and probably also the extinct monotypic genus Kaolakia from mid-Cretaceous Alaskan amber.

These features indicate that the new specimen represents a new armoured morphotype of planthopper nymph from the fossil record.","[Luo, Cihang; Wang, Bo; Jarzembowski, Edmund A.] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Luo, Cihang; Wang, Bo; Jarzembowski, Edmund A.] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Luo, Cihang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China","Luo, CH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China.; Luo, CH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China.; Luo, CH (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",chluo@nigpas.ac.cn; bowang@nigpas.ac.cn; jarzembowski2@live.co.uk,,"Luo, Cihang/0000-0002-4855-6185",Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB26000000]; Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research [2019QZKK0706]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41688103]; Chinese Academy of Sciences' President's International Fellowship Initiative (PIFI); Leverhulme FellowshipLeverhulme Trust [IGCP 679],"This research was funded by the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDB26000000), the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (2019QZKK0706), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41688103) and the Chinese Academy of Sciences' President's International Fellowship Initiative (PIFI).

These specimens provide useful clues to understand the paleobiogeographic evolution of the tLancepyrinae, since they are only predated by genera described from Lebanese and Spanish amber. These new taxa suggest a major paleobiogeographic scenario, since Burmese amber was probably produced on an island that separated from Gondwana during the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous.

One new species of Embolemopsis from Barremian Wealden amber (UK), is described: Ep. maryannae sp. nov., the oldest known embolemid wasp and the first hymenopteran described from Wealden amber. The genus Ponomarenkoa is transferred from Dryinidae to Embolemidae. A new species of Ponomarenkoa (P. burmensis sp. nov.) is described from Cenomanian Kachin amber. The genera of Embolemidae are divided into three groups. The phylogenetic significance of the new species of Embolemidae and the history of the family are discussed. Nymphs of Cixiidae and Achilidae are recorded as hosts of Embolemidae. Possible hosts of fossil embolemids are discussed. For the first time, Achilidae (Protepiptera kaweckii, from Baltic amber) are recorded as hosts of Dryinidae. Protepiptera kaweckii is also recorded for the first time from Rovno amber.

NOV.; WASPS; STEPHANOIDEA; CHECKLIST; SAWFLIES; FAMILY; ANTS; BEES,"A review of non-aculeate hymenoptera recorded in the world's Cretaceous amber assemblages is provided herein. Recorded are 287 species (265 named) representing 47 families in 17 amber assemblages. The richest in family number is the Burmese (Kachin) amber (35), followed by Canadian (19), Spanish (15), Kheta (12), Raritan (11), Charentese (10), Agapa (9) and Levantine (7) ones; hymenopterans in other ambers are less well documented. In the eight mentioned amber faunas, the share of extinct families decreases from 50/53 to 21 percent in a good correlation with their putative age, therefore suggesting a contiguous character of the studied world fauna. This inference is confirmed by the fact that endemic families are not recorded, with the only but prominent exception of the insular Burmese (Kachin) fauna with its 8 endemic families (23% of known hymenopteran families there). The rate of gradual loss of extinct families in succeeding amber assemblages shows that the main transformation took place during the first half of the Late Cretaceous, and not the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary. As taxonomic revisions, two species are placed in different families than originally ascribed to, namely, Albiogonalys elongatus Nel, Perrichot & Neraudeau, 2003, is transferred to Praeaulacidae, and Phoriostephanus exilis Engel & Huang, 2017, is transferred from Stephanidae to Roproniidae.

Interestingly, at least ten different fossil species have been described from inclusions in Upper Cretaceous Burmese amber. This suggests the family has been diversifying in the region for at least-100 million years. In this paper, we revise the taxonomy of fossil species of this family and the closely related Ochyroceratidae, based on the reexamination of type specimens of described species. We find that ten Cretaceous species described in the psilodercid genera Priscaleclercera and Aculeatosoma are valid, and present new illustrations of their type material. The genus Propterpsiloderces apparently does not belong to Psilodercidae, but rather to a family representing a stem lineage within Scytodoidea. Ochyroceratidae is represented in the fossil record by a single ochyroceratine genus from Miocene Dominican amber, Arachnolithulus. The original combination of the extant species Leclercera spinata Deeleman-Reinhold, 1995 is reinstated by transferring it from Priscaleclercera, leaving this latter genus as a strictly fossil taxon. Finally, we present the description of a hitherto unknown species of Priscaleclercera from mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber, Priscaleclercera christae sp. nov., bringing the total number of congeners to ten. By studying its morphological features, we argue that Priscaleclercera is a crown-group Psilodercidae, closely related to the AlthepuseLeclercera lineage. The high species diversity of Priscaleclercera indicates that Psilodercidae was already a diverse component of the Oriental tropical forests during the Cretaceous. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The beetle's unusual elongate and subcylindrical body with a long prothorax and appendages suggest that they may have occupied subcortical spaces. A phylogenetic analysis under maximum parsimony recovered Kulindrobor gen. nov. as sister to a member of the poorly-defined, polyphyletic Melandryidae with low support. Given that the higher classification and family boundaries in Tenebrionoidea still remain to be fully resolved and that Kulindrobor differs profoundly from all recent melandryids, we provisionally place the new genus as family incertae sedis within Tenebrionoidea.

Here we describe the first extinct genus of Nosodendridae from mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber from northern Myanmar (ca. 99 Ma). Basinosa pengwen gen. et sp. nov. can be distinguished from extant genera by a combination of potentially plesiomorphic characters, namely its strongly protuberant compound eyes, long prosternum, slender tarsi, elongate tibiae not strongly widened apically, and metacoxae narrowly separated by a sharp anterior process of the basalmost abdominal ventrite. The new fossil provides further evidence of an ancient origin of Nosodendridae and a 'missing link' between the family and more basal polyphagan superfamilies. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

It differs by the presence of a parietal inclusion in the aperture and by the weakly convex whorls with dense, diagonally aligned ribs on the last whorl. The genus Euthema is redescribed, and a new synonym recognised, Paleodiplommatina. A list of all currently described molluscan species from Burmese amber is provided. Lagocheilus electrospira is reassigned to the genus Eotrichophorus. The taxonomic diversity and abundance of molluscs in Burmese amber are discussed on the basis of 198 observed snail inclusions from amber trading exchange and published data. Apparently, molluscs are much more common in Burmese amber than in any other deposit of amber, with a notable predominance of Cyclophoroidea.

In the contemporary fauna, this small, relict subfamily occurs mainly in tropical and sub-tropical regions. Examination of inclusions preserved in the Upper Cretaceous amber of Myanmar (also known as Burmese amber), which is almost 100 mya, shows that this subfamily was abundant during the Cretaceous period. The extinct genus Palaeoglaesum is known only from this fossil resin. Moreover, its numerous inclusions and high diversification confirm that the Mesozoic was the stage of the early evolution and radiation of Psychodidae. Here we describe three new species and we provide additional details regarding the morphology of fossil species. Cretaceous Myanmar amber is abundant in inclusions belonging to the genus Palaeoglaesum. In addition, a significant morphological diversity among representatives of Palaeoglaesum can be observed. However, none of its representatives have been found in other fossil materials. Herein three new species: P. stebneri sp. nov., Skibinska and Krzeminski P. teres sp. nov. Skibinska and Albrycht, and P. pilosus sp. nov. Skibinska, Krzeminski and Zhang from Cretaceous Myanmar amber are described and illustrated. The very small size and characters of male hypopygium with aedeagus strongly bent and apically forked are pertinent to diagnosing the genus and species. New materials show that this genus and the whole subfamily Bruchomyiinae were probably more abundant and more diverse than the presently known extant fauna.","[Skibinska, Kornelia; Krzeminski, Wieslaw] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Systemat & Evolut Anim, Slawkowska 17, PL-31016 Krakow, Poland; [Albrycht, Marzena] Pedag Univ Krakow, Inst Biol, Podchorazych 2, PL-30084 Krakow, Poland; [Zhang, Qingqing] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qingqing] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qingqing] Univ Bonn, Inst Geosci, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Gilka, Wojciech; Zakrzewska, Marta] Univ Gdansk, Fac Biol, Dept Invertebrate Zool & Parasitol, Lab Systemat Zool, Wita Stwosza 59, PL-80308 Gdansk, Poland","Skibinska, K (corresponding author), Polish Acad Sci, Inst Systemat & Evolut Anim, Slawkowska 17, PL-31016 Krakow, Poland.",yukisiak@gmail.com; marzena.albrycht@up.krakow.pl; qqzhang@nigpas.ac.cn; wojciech.gilka@ug.edu.pl; marta.zakrzewska@ug.edu.pl; wieslawk4@gmail.com,,"Zakrzewska, Marta/0000-0002-5125-8656; Skibinska, Kornelia/0000-0002-5971-9373; Krzeminski, Wieslaw/0000-0001-5685-891X","National Science Centre, PolandNational Science Centre, Poland [2016/23/B/NZ8/00936]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB26000000]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41688103]; Alexander von Humboldt FoundationAlexander von Humboldt Foundation","This research was funded by the National Science Centre, Poland No. 2016/23/B/NZ8/00936), the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDB26000000), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41688103).

With description here of two new and significant taxa, Cretacoptila botosaneanui gen. et sp. nov. and Electrocentropus dilucidus gen. et sp. nov. a total of 34 named species are listed, distributed among 10 families. Several taxonomic changes are made: two established species are transferred to more-appropriate genera, becoming Neucentropus macularis (Wang et al., 2019) comb. nov. and Myanpsyche malaisei (Wichard & Wang, 2019) comb. nov.; a new extinct subfamily dagger Burminoptilinae subfamily nov. is proposed in the family Hydroptilidae and two extinct families, dagger Burmapsychidae fam. nov. and dagger Cretapsychidae fam. nov., are proposed for the superfamily Sericostomatoidea. The small size of adults of many of these species is remarkable. With their 2-4 mm length forewings they are smaller than their next relatives in the Baltic Amber and even much smaller than their present representatives. Thus, not only are the hydroptilids microcaddisflies, but also philopotamids of the genus Wormaldia and psychomyiids of the extinct genus Palerasnitsynus, which, being the most common caddisflies in Burmese amber, apparently tended to swarm.

The systematic position of the family within Cucujoidea is unresolved, with morphological and molecular studies yielding a range of incongruent topologies. Here we describe a new cyclaxyrid genus and species, Pacyclaxyra azari gen. et sp. nov., from mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber mined in northern Myanmar (ca. 99 Ma). The new genus is separated from all other cyclaxyrids by its unusually large body size, dorsally concealed antennal insertions, narrowly separated procoxae, narrow prosternal process not expanded at apex, and presence of a distinct discrimen on metaventrite. Together with Electroxyra cretacea described from the same deposit, Pacyclaxyra gen. nov. represents the earliest sooty mould beetle in the fossil record. Considering the potentially plesiomorphic characters possessed by Pacyclaxyra azari gen. et sp. nov., the implications for understanding the systematic position of Cyclaxyridae are discussed.

This is particularly true for the early flies (lower Diptera) which underwent rapid radiation during the Cretaceous period. Here we describe a remarkable nematocerous fossil fly which shows a character typical of the flies of the suborder Brachycera-with strongly modified antenna-representing new evidence that such a Brachycera-like modification of the antennae has evolved several times during the evolutionary history of Diptera. A new fossil genus of Bibionidae (Diptera: Bibionomorpha), Burmahesperinus gen. nov., from the mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber, is described and illustrated (type species Burmahesperinus antennatus sp. nov., the other two species included are B. conicus sp. nov. and B. pedicellatus sp. nov.). The new genus is tentatively placed in a new subfamily, Burmahesperininae subfam. nov. of the family Bibionidae. Its possible phylogenetic position is briefly discussed. The new genus, as well as the subfamily, possesses the wing venation similar to the recent genus Hesperinus Walker, 1848, in combination with Brachycera-like modification of both the male and female antenna and the overall habitus typical of fungus gnats (Sciaroidea).","[Sevcik, Jan] Univ Ostrava, Dept Biol & Ecol, Fac Sci, Chittussiho 10, Ostrava 71000, Czech Republic; [Skartveit, John] NLA Univ Coll Bergen, Dept Teacher Educ, POB 74 Sandviken, N-5812 Bergen, Norway; [Krzeminski, Wieslaw; Skibinska, Kornelia] Polish Acad Sci, Inst Systemat & Evolut Anim, Slawkowska 17, PL-31016 Krakow, Poland","Sevcik, J (corresponding author), Univ Ostrava, Dept Biol & Ecol, Fac Sci, Chittussiho 10, Ostrava 71000, Czech Republic.",sevcikjan@hotmail.com; John.Skartveit@NLA.no; wieslawk4@gmail.com; yukisiak@gmail.com,,"Skibinska, Kornelia/0000-0002-5971-9373; Sevcik, Jan/0000-0001-7174-593X; Krzeminski, Wieslaw/0000-0001-5685-891X","National Science Centre of PolandNational Science Centre, Poland [UMO2016/23/B/NZ8/00936]","This research was funded by National Science Centre of Poland (grant number UMO2016/23/B/NZ8/00936) and by the institutional support for the University of Ostrava provided by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic.",,33,0,0,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-4450,,INSECTS,Insects,APR,2021,12,4,,,,,,,364,10.3390/insects12040364,,,11,Entomology,Entomology,RR4LC,WOS:000643070800001,33923888,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,20/07/2021

Herein we report the first fossil record of Vietnamellidae based on a male and female imago from Mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber. We establish the new genus Burmella gen. nov. to accommodate these two new Mesozoic specimens. Their attribution to Vietnamellidae is supported by the rounded shape of the hind wings with arched outer margin, the course of thoracic sutures, and characteristics of venation, especially of MP and Cu of the forewings and associated intercalary veins of the cubital field. At the same time, Burmella gen. nov. clearly differs from Vietnamella by a diminished number of longitudinal and cross veins in the hind wings, and by the different shape of male genitalia. This first fossil record of Vietnamellidae supports an age of at least 100 Ma for this taxon.","[Godunko, Roman J.] Czech Acad Sci, Biol Ctr, Inst Entomol, Branisovska 31, Ceske Budejovice 37005, Czech Republic; [Godunko, Roman J.] Univ Lodz, Dept Invertebrate Zool & Hydrobiol, Banacha 12-16, PL-90237 Lodz, Poland; [Godunko, Roman J.] Natl Acad Sci Ukraine, State Museum Nat Hist, Teatralna 18, UA-79008 Lvov, Ukraine; [Martynov, Alexander, V] Natl Acad Sci Ukraine, Natl Museum Nat Hist, Bohdan Khmelnytsky 15, UA-01030 Kiev, Ukraine; [Staniczek, Arnold H.] State Museum Nat Hist Stuttgart, Dept Entomol, Rosenstein 1, D-70191 Stuttgart, Germany","Staniczek, AH (corresponding author), State Museum Nat Hist Stuttgart, Dept Entomol, Rosenstein 1, D-70191 Stuttgart, Germany.",arnold.staniczek@smns-bw.de,,"Martynov, Alexander/0000-0002-6506-5134",Grant Agency of the Czech RepublicGrant Agency of the Czech Republic [21-05216S]; Georg Forster Research Fellowship for Experienced Researchers by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation in 2019; SYNTHESYS - European Community Research Infrastructure Action in 2020;  [RVO 60077344],"We are grateful to Patrick Muller, Kashofen, Germany, for donating the specimens to SMNS.

The earliest fossils of phoroid flies are from Early Cretaceous. In this paper we describe a second species of the enigmatic phoroid fly genus Lebambromyia. The genus was erected to accommodate an extinct species, L. acrai Grimaldi and Cumming, from Lebanese amber deposit, dated at ca. 120 Mya. A new species, L. sacculifera sp. nov., is described here based on a single female specimen embedded in Myanmar mid-Cretaceous amber, which is over 20 Ma younger than the Lebanese outcrop, implying that this genus had a wide geographic and temporal distribution. The state of preservation of the new specimen and its study with phase contrast X-ray microtomography show that this ancient fly was characterized by a mix of ancient and modern features, such as specialized sensory areas in the antenna. Phylogenetic analyses support that Lebambromyia was related to flat-footed and ironic flies, but a clear phylogenetic position remains elusive. Lebambromyia sacculifera sp. nov. is described from Late Cretaceous amber from Myanmar, integrating traditional observation techniques and X-ray phase contrast microtomography. Lebambromyia sacculifera is the second species of Lebambromyia after L. acrai Grimaldi and Cumming, described from Lebanese amber (Early Cretaceous), and the first record of this taxon from Myanmar amber, considerably extending the temporal and geographic range of this genus. The new specimen bears a previously undetected set of phylogenetically relevant characters such as a postpedicel sacculus and a prominent clypeus, which are shared with Ironomyiidae and Eumuscomorpha. Our cladistic analyses confirmed that Lebambromyia represented a distinct monophyletic lineage related to Platypezidae and Ironomyiidae, though its affinities are strongly influenced by the interpretation and coding of the enigmatic set of features characterizing these fossil flies.","[Badano, Davide; Cerretti, Pierfilippo] Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Biol & Biotechnol Charles Darwin, Piazzale A Moro 5, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Badano, Davide; Cerretti, Pierfilippo] Sapienza Univ Rome, Museum Zool, Piazzale Valerio Massimo 6, I-00162 Rome, Italy; [Zhang, Qingqing] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qingqing] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qingqing] Univ Bonn, Inst Geosci, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Fratini, Michela; Maugeri, Laura; Bukreeva, Inna] Sapienza Univ Rome, CNR Nanotec Rome Unit, Dept Phys, Piazzale A Moro 5, I-00185 Rome, Italy; [Bukreeva, Inna] Russian Acad Sci, PN Lebedev Phys Inst, Moscow 119991, Russia; [Longo, Elena; Wilde, Fabian] Inst Mat Phys, Helmholtz Zentrum Geesthacht, Max Planck Str 1, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany; [Yeates, David K.; Cerretti, Pierfilippo] CSIRO Natl Facil & Collect, Australian Natl Insect Collect, Clunies Ross St, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia","Badano, D; Cerretti, P (corresponding author), Sapienza Univ Rome, Dept Biol & Biotechnol Charles Darwin, Piazzale A Moro 5, I-00185 Rome, Italy.; Badano, D; Cerretti, P (corresponding author), Sapienza Univ Rome, Museum Zool, Piazzale Valerio Massimo 6, I-00162 Rome, Italy.; Cerretti, P (corresponding author), CSIRO Natl Facil & Collect, Australian Natl Insect Collect, Clunies Ross St, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia.",davide.badano@uniroma1.it; qqzhang@nigpas.ac.cn; michela.fratini@gmail.com; maugeri83@gmail.com; innabukreeva@yahoo.it; elena.longo@hzg.de; fabian.wilde@hzg.de; david.yeates@csiro.au; pierfilippo.cerretti@uniroma1.it,"Yeates, David K/A-9917-2008; Badano, Davide/J-5943-2019; Cerretti, Pierfilippo/L-6504-2016; Bukreeva, Inna/M-7946-2015","Yeates, David K/0000-0001-7729-6143; Badano, Davide/0000-0001-9715-3107; Cerretti, Pierfilippo/0000-0002-9204-3352; Bukreeva, Inna/0000-0003-1483-4965; Wilde, Fabian/0000-0002-6080-3601","SAPIExcellence BE-FOR-ERC fellowship (Sapienza University of Rome); Alexander von Humboldt Foundation from GermanyAlexander von Humboldt Foundation; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB26000000]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41688103]; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation)German Research Foundation (DFG) [SFB 986, 192346071]","D.B. was supported by a SAPIExcellence BE-FOR-ERC fellowship (Sapienza University of Rome).

A new genus and species, Cantabroberotha soplaensis gen. et sp. nov., are erected based on a complete amber specimen from the El Soplao outcrop (Cantabria, northern Spain). Four indeterminate berothids based on incomplete specimens are described from Periacerrada I amber (Burgos, northern Spain). One of these provides a rare instance of an amber fossil being partially preserved as an impression rather than as a complete inclusion. This was the result of the lacewing not fully penetrating into a resin flow, its wings getting caught on the resin surface and leaving an imprint. The preservation of this delicate impression fossil allows us to infer that a low grade transport likely occurred, at least partly, during the biostratinomic phase of the genesis of the Pertacerrada I amber deposit, similar to what was inferred for the El Soplao amber deposit. Moreover, one of the incomplete berothid inclusions has an indeterminate, likely immature mesostigmatan mite attached to the proximal part of its hind wing, most parsimoniously resulting from a symbiotic interaction, probably phoresy.

Amber fossils have contributed to the understanding of the phylogeny, biology, and biogeography of insects and other groups, and have also gained great importance for dating molecular trees. Another major potential is the documentation of faunal, floral and climatic shifts. Evolutionary transitions can be well-documented in amber fossils and can reveal anatomical transformations and the age of appearance of structural features. Here, using a new stem group species of Strepsiptera from Burmite, we evaluate this potential of amber insect fossils to assess the current phylogeny of Strepsiptera, with the main emphasis on the early splitting events in the stem group. Amber fossils have greatly contributed to the understanding of the evolution of Strepsiptera in the late Mesozoic and the Cenozoic. dagger Heterobathmilla kakopoiosPohl and Beutelgen. et sp. n.described here is placed in the stem group of the order, in a clade with dagger Kinzelbachilla(dagger Kinzelbachillidae) and dagger Phthanoxenos(dagger Phthanoxenidae). dagger Phthanoxenidae has priority over dagger Kinzelbachillidae, and the latter is synonymised. The superb details available from this new fossil allowed us to explore unique features of the antennae, mouthparts, and male copulatory apparatus, and to provide a phylogenetic hypothesis for the order. The younger dagger Protoxenosfrom Eocene Baltic amber was confirmed as sister to all remaining extinct and extant groups of Strepsiptera, whereas the position of the Cretaceous dagger Cretostylopsin the stem group remains ambivalent. While the value of Burmite and amber from other periods has a recognized impact on our knowledge of the evolution in various lineages, this new fossil does not fundamentally change our picture of the phylogeny and evolution of early Strepsiptera. However, it offers new insights into the morphological diversity in the early evolution of the group.","[Pohl, Hans; Beutel, Rolf Georg] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Zool & Evolutionsforsch, Entomol Grp, Erbertstr 1, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Wipfler, Benjamin] Zool Forschungsmuseum Alexander Koenig, Bonn, Germany; [Boudinot, Brendon] Univ Calif Davis, Dept Entomol Nematol, One Shields Ave, Davis, CA 95616 USA","Pohl, H; Beutel, RG (corresponding author), Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Zool & Evolutionsforsch, Entomol Grp, Erbertstr 1, D-07743 Jena, Germany.",hans.pohl@uni-jena.de; rolf.beutel@uni-jena.de,"Pohl, Hans/M-6873-2019",,Zoologisches Forschungsmuseum Alexander Koenig (Bonn),"We thank Birgit Perner (Leibniz-Institut fur Alternsforschung - Fritz-Lippmann-Institut, Jena) for providing us access to the Axio Zoom.V16.

We discuss the differences between the middle Eocene Baltic amber genus Archankothrips and Ankothrips, concluding that the two genera are extremely similar with only one significant difference in male specimens. The disjunctive distribution of the extant species along with the presence of one Late Cretaceous species strongly suggest an Early Cretaceous origin for Ankothrips. The genus is therefore very ancient and has had a remarkable morphological stability for the last 94 million years. This situation is unique among the Cretaceous thrips, and rare among insects (only c. 3% of the genera in the well-documented mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber are still extant).

Herein, we review the termites and related inclusions reported from Cretaceous amber. Studies on fossil termites have been active in the last two decades with the discoveries of diverse taxa, early eusociality, feeding habits, termitophiles, etc. Termite interactions have been demonstrated by either co-embedded specimens or specialized morphologies known from the extant evidence.

The new coreid, with elaborately formed antennae and simple hind legs instead of the typical extant coreid morphology with simple antennae and elaborately formed hind legs, begs the question: why were the elaborate features of the antennae lost in favor of ornate hind legs? Features that are large and showy are at higher risk of being attacked by predators or stuck in a poor molt and subjected to autotomy and are therefore lost at a higher rate than simple appendages. We hypothesize that because elaborate antennae play an additional significant sensory role compared to elaborate hind legs, that evolutionarily it is more costly to have elaborate antennae versus elaborate hind legs. Thus, through the millenia, as coreid evolution experimented with elaborate/ornate features, those on the antennae were likely selected against in favor of ornate hind legs.","[Cumming, Royce T. .; Le Tirant, Stephane] Montreal Insectarium, 4581 Rue Sherbrooke Est, Montreal, PQ H1X 2B2, Canada; [Cumming, Royce T. .] Amer Museum Nat Hist, Richard Gilder Grad Sch, New York, NY 10024 USA; [Cumming, Royce T. .] CUNY, Grad Ctr, Biol, New York, NY 10010 USA","Cumming, RT (corresponding author), Montreal Insectarium, 4581 Rue Sherbrooke Est, Montreal, PQ H1X 2B2, Canada.; Cumming, RT (corresponding author), Amer Museum Nat Hist, Richard Gilder Grad Sch, New York, NY 10024 USA.; Cumming, RT (corresponding author), CUNY, Grad Ctr, Biol, New York, NY 10010 USA.",phylliidae.walkingleaf@gmail.com,,"Cumming, Royce T./0000-0001-7930-1292",,,,34,0,0,0,0,PENSOFT PUBLISHERS,SOFIA,"12 PROF GEORGI ZLATARSKI ST, SOFIA, 1700, BULGARIA",1313-2989,1313-2970,,ZOOKEYS,ZooKeys,Jun-11,2021,,1043,,,,,117,131,,10.3897/zookeys.1043.67730,,,15,Zoology,Zoology,SV9NV,WOS:000664146000005,34163298,"DOAJ Gold, Green Published",,,20/07/2021

During entomological field work in rain forests of central Vietnam a new species of Micropterigidae was discovered. It is described herein as Aureopterix bachmaensis sp. nov. based on male and female specimens collected at light in the Bach-Ma National Park. The identification was corroborated by a molecular analysis. This is the first record of this genus in the Northern Hemisphere, previously thought to be restricted to the Australian Region (including New Caledonia). First results of investigations of Burmese amber inclusions now reveal the presence of the Australian Region families Agathiphagidae and Lophocoronidae in the Cretaceous of Asia. The fossil taxon Agathiphagama perdita gen. nov., sp. nov. is established on the basis of two females and this is assigned to Agathiphagidae. The fossil genus Acanthocorona gen. nov. is established in Lophocoronidae and includes seven species described here as A. skalskii sp. nov., A. bowangi sp. nov., A. muelleri sp. nov., A. kuranishii sp. nov., A. sattleri sp. nov., A. spinifera sp. nov. and A. wichardi sp. nov. The new species can be distinguished by the male genitalia which are illustrated together with wing venation and other morphological characters. The disjunct ranges of these taxa are discussed in a historical biogeographic context. Vicariance and dispersal hypotheses explaining the disjunct pattern are discussed. The discovery of these new species suggests a broader ancestral range of Aureopterix, Agathiphagidae and Lophocoronidae. Their extant ranges may be regarded as remnants or relicts of a wider distribution in the Mesozoic, or at least in the case of Aureopterix they could be the results of recent or ancient dispersal processes, since the calibration of molecular splits does not so far accord with plate tectonics.","[Mey, Wolfram; Leger, Theo] Leibniz Inst Evolut & Biodivers Res, Museum Naturkunde, Invalidenstr 43, D-10115 Berlin, Germany; [Vu Van Lien] Vietnam Natl Museum Nat, Hanoi, Vietnam","Mey, W (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Evolut & Biodivers Res, Museum Naturkunde, Invalidenstr 43, D-10115 Berlin, Germany.",wolfram.mey@mfn.de; Theo.Leger@mfn.berlin; vulien@vnmn.vast.vn,,,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF)Federal Ministry of Education & Research (BMBF) [01 DP17052],"We thank J.

We describe here a new lacewing larva, Ankyloleon caudatus gen. et sp.n. (Neuroptera) from the Cretaceous amber of Myanmar, characterized by an abdomen unique among insects, with 'tail-like' terminal segments bearing a ventral pair of vesicles. Phase-contrast X-ray microtomography reveals that these structures were dense and equipped with a median duct, suggesting that they were likely pygopods used for locomotion, holding the position through adhesive secretions. Our phylogenetic analyses, combining genomic and morphological data from both living and fossil lacewings, proved critical to placing Ankyloleon gen.n. on the lacewing tree of life as an early representative of the antlion clade, Myrmeleontiformia. These results corroborate the view that derived myrmeleontiform lacewings 'experimented' with unusual combinations of features and specializations during their evolutionary history, some of which are now lost.

The evolution of bioluminescence in elateroids is associated with unusual morphological modifications, such as soft-bodiedness and neoteny, but the fragmentary nature of the fossil record discloses little about the origin of these adaptations. We report the discovery of a new bioluminescent elateroid beetle family from the mid-Cretaceous of northern Myanmar (ca 99 Ma), Cretophengodidae fam. nov. Cretophengodes azari gen. et sp. nov. belongs to the bioluminescent lampyroid clade, and would appear to represent a transitional fossil linking the soft-bodied Phengodidae + Rhagophthalmidae clade and hard-bodied elateroids. The fossil male possesses a light organ on the abdomen which presumably served a defensive function, documenting a Cretaceous radiation of bioluminescent beetles coinciding with the diversification of major insectivore groups such as frogs and stem-group birds. The discovery adds a key branch to the elateroid tree of life and sheds light on the evolution of soft-bodiedness and the historical biogeography of elateroid beetles.","[Li, Yan-Da; Huang, Diying; Cai, Chenyang] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Li, Yan-Da; Huang, Diying; Cai, Chenyang] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Palaeoenvironm, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Li, Yan-Da] Peking Univ, Sch Life Sci, Beijing 100871, Peoples R China; [Kundrata, Robin] Palacky Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, Olomouc 77900, Czech Republic; [Tihelka, Erik; Cai, Chenyang] Univ Bristol, Sch Earth Sci, Life Sci Bldg,Tyndall Ave, Bristol BS8 1TQ, Avon, England; [Liu, Zhenhua] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Biocontrol, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zhenhua] CSIRO, Natl Res Collect Australia, Australian Natl Insect Collect, GPO Box 1700, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia","Cai, CY (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China.; Cai, CY (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Palaeoenvironm, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China.; Cai, CY (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Sch Earth Sci, Life Sci Bldg,Tyndall Ave, Bristol BS8 1TQ, Avon, England.",cycai@nigpas.ac.cn,"Tihelka, Erik/AAF-9541-2021; KUNDRATA, Robin/AAI-5445-2021","Tihelka, Erik/0000-0002-5048-5355; Liu, Zhenhua/0000-0002-2739-3305; Kundrata, Robin/0000-0001-9397-1030; Li, Yan-Da/0000-0002-9439-202X","Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB26000000, XDB18000000]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41672011, 41688103]; Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research project [2019QZKK0706]","This work has been supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (grant nos.

Little has been known about their early diversification, character evolution, phylogeny and historical biogeography because of limited fossil material and lack of a phylogeny integrating extant and extinct representatives. Here we report an unexpectedly diverse dasycerine fauna from the mid-Cretaceous of northern Myanmar, including a new genus and four new species. To reconstruct the early evolutionary history of Dasycerinae, we present a phylogenetic framework of the subfamily based on a dataset integrating all extant and extinct taxa using parsimony, maximum-likelihood and Bayesian methods. dagger Cedasyrusgen. n., characterized by distinct sexual dimorphism in antennal and elytral lengths, is recovered as the basal-most lineage, sister to the remaining two extinct genera and all livingDasycerusspecies. dagger Vetudasycerusis recovered as sister to dagger Protodasycerus + Dasycerus. Among all extinct taxa, dagger Protodasycerusbears distinctly longer elytra, and appears to represent a transitional form from dagger VetudasycerustoDasycerus. Phylogenetic inferences and ancestral distribution reconstruction support an Out-of-Orient model for Dasycerinae. Either the Bering- or North Atlantic Land Bridge may have served as a passageway for dasycerine dispersal between Eurasian and North American continents. An elevation-reconstruction analysis indicated that the ancestor of the extantDasycerusprobably lived at a high altitude and stayed at this elevation through the end of the Miocene. We propose that the extinction of dasycerine ancestors living on the Tethyan islands at low altitude was likely caused by sea-level rise and climatic warming during the Late Cretaceous. The high-altitude areas might have played the role of refugia that harboured subalpine derivatives which eventually gave rise to the extantDasycerus.","[Yin, Zi-Wei] Shanghai Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Lab Systemat Entomol, Shanghai 200234, Peoples R China; [Lu, Liang] Hebei Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Key Lab Anim Physiol Biochem & Mol Biol Hebei Pro, Shijiazhuang 050024, Hebei, Peoples R China; [Yamamoto, Shuhei; Thayer, Margaret K.; Newton, Alfred F.] Field Museum Nat Hist, Integrat Res Ctr, 1400 S Lake Shore Dr,7, Chicago, IL 60605 USA; [Cai, Chen-Yang] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Cai, Chen-Yang] Univ Bristol, Sch Earth Sci, Life Sci Bldg,Tyndall Ave, Bristol BS8 1TQ, Avon, England","Yin, ZW (corresponding author), Shanghai Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Lab Systemat Entomol, Shanghai 200234, Peoples R China.; Lu, L (corresponding author), Hebei Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Key Lab Anim Physiol Biochem & Mol Biol Hebei Pro, Shijiazhuang 050024, Hebei, Peoples R China.",pselaphinae@gmail.com; lianges.luex@gmail.com,"Yamamoto, Shuhei/U-8247-2018","Yamamoto, Shuhei/0000-0002-4162-8457; Lu, Liang/0000-0001-7533-6244","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [31872965, 31501883]; Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB26000000]; Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research [2019QZKK0706]; Natural Science Foundation of Hebei ProvinceNatural Science Foundation of Hebei Province [C2018205123]; Shanghai Phosphor Science Foundation, China [19QA1406600]; JSPS (Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, Tokyo, Japan) Overseas Research FellowshipMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [29-212]","We thank David Maddison (OSAC) for providing additional fossil material used in the study.

Despite the recently increasing rate of fossil research focused on the click-beetles (Coleoptera: Elateridae), the major group in the superfamily Elateroidea, their palaeodiversity has still remained largely understudied. In this study, we summarized current knowledge on the click-beetle fossil record with a main emphasis on the described diversity. We compiled an annotated catalogue of all described fossil species in Elateridae, assessed the reliability of their systematic placement, and discuss the current state of knowledge and prospects of research of the fossil record in the group. This study should serve as a comprehensive basis for all subsequent research dealing with the origin, early evolution and diversity of Elateridae. The Elateridae (click-beetles) are the largest family in Elateroidea; however, their relationships, systematics and classification remain unclear. Our understanding of the origin, evolution, palaeodiversity and palaeobiogeography of Elateridae, as well as reconstruction of a reliable time-calibrated phylogeny for the group, are hampered by the lack of detailed knowledge of their fossil record. In this study, we summarize the current knowledge on all described fossil species in Elateridae, including their type material, geographic origin, age, bibliography and remarks on their systematic placement. Altogether, 261 fossil species classified in 99 genera and nine subfamilies are currently listed in this family. The Mesozoic click-beetle diversity includes 143 species, with most of them described from the Jurassic Karatau, and 118 described species are known from the Cenozoic deposits, mainly from the Eocene North American Florissant Formation and European Baltic amber. Available data on the described past diversity of Elateridae suggest that almost all fossil lineages in this group are in urgent need of revision and numerous Mesozoic species might belong to different families. Our study is intended to serve as a comprehensive basis for all subsequent research focused on the click-beetle fossil record.","[Kundrata, Robin; Packova, Gabriela; Hoffmannova, Johana] Palacky Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, 17 Listopadu 50, Olomouc 77146, Czech Republic; [Prosvirov, Alexander S.] Moscow MV Lomonosov State Univ, Fac Biol, Dept Entomol, Leninskie Gory 1-12, Moscow 119234, Russia","Kundrata, R (corresponding author), Palacky Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, 17 Listopadu 50, Olomouc 77146, Czech Republic.",robin.kundrata@upol.cz; gabriela.packova01@upol.cz; carrabus69@mail.ru; johana.hoffmannova01@upol.cz,,"Prosvirov, Alexander/0000-0002-1415-548X; Kundrata, Robin/0000-0001-9397-1030",Palacky University [IGA_PrF_2021_019]; Moscow State University; Moscow State University [AAAA-A16-116021660095-7],"This research was funded by the internal grant of the Palacky University nr.

Here, a new genus and species of Passalidae, Protopassalus araripensis gen. et sp. nov., is described based on a well-preserved fossil in laminated limestone from the Crato Formation (Santana Group, Lower Cretaceous, upper Aptian), collected in a quarry near Nova Olinda, Chapada do Araripe, State of Ceara, Brazil. This specimen is the oldest passalid fossil and the first record for the family in the Santana Group, and aids in understanding the origin and radiation of terrestrial Coleoptera. Protopassalus araripensis gen. et sp. nov. shows characteristics of the subfamily Passalinae, representing the oldest record of this group and suggesting that the family emerged over 150 Ma. The new genus is attributed to this subfamily based on: outline of head and eyes with strongly convex frontal area, posteriorly grooved and curve, with incomplete central tubercle; pronotum rounded at sides with longitudinal groove; mesothorax with narrowing connection with abdomen, dorsally evident; elytra longitudinally striated and with similar dorsal striae and interstriae.

Recent phylogenetic studies suggest a sister relationship of Diochini and a lineage formed by Xantholinini, Maorothiini, and Othiini, within the subfamily Staphylininae. Here, we describe the first known endogean representative of Diochini, Diochus occultus n. sp., and provide the first two complete mitogenomes for the tribe, corresponding to the two European Diochus species: Diochus occultus n. sp. and Diochus staudingeri. These sequences were combined with 40 additional mitogenomes from representatives within Staphylininae, Paederinae, Silphidae, and Aleocharinae, and COI sequences from 5 additional species of Diochus to conduct a series of mitogenomic phylogenetic and dating analyses. The estimated molecular phylogeny is fully consistent with previous studies based on morphology and molecular data, finding a sister relationship of Diochini with a clade formed by Xantholinini and Othiini (Maorothiini not sampled). Dating analyses inferred an early split of the tribe Diochini at 140-156 Mya. Morphology shows clear differences in the aedeagal and external morphology of D. occultus n. sp. and D. staudingeri, whereas a sister relationship of these taxa is found in the phylogenetic analyses, with the split dated at 48-61 Mya. Although the study of additional Palaearctic Diochus species will be required to conclusively establish that D. occultus n. sp. is a palaeoendemic taxon sister to D. staudingeri, associated with forests of Abies pinsapo in the south of the Iberian Peninsula, this conclusion is consistent with the ancient estimated age of speciation, endogean habitat specificity, low dispersal capacity (flightless species), and microendemicity of D. occultus. This is also consistent with the continued emersion of the Betic sub-plate along its tectonic evolution. The estimated ages of diversification of the Paederinae-Staphylininae lineage are also discussed.","[Hernando, Carles] POB 118, E-08911 Badalona, Catalonia, Spain; [Andujar, Carmelo] CSIC, Isl Ecol & Evolut Res Grp, Inst Prod Nat & Agrobiol IPNA, San Cristobal la Laguna, Spain","Andujar, C (corresponding author), CSIC, Isl Ecol & Evolut Res Grp, Inst Prod Nat & Agrobiol IPNA, Tenerife 38206, Canary Islands, Spain.",candujar@ipna.csic.es,"Andujar, Carmelo/AAA-7548-2020","Andujar, Carmelo/0000-0001-9759-7402",Ministerio de Economia y CompetitividadSpanish Government [CGL2015-74178-JIN],"Ministerio de Economia y Competitividad, Grant/Award Number: CGL2015-74178-JIN",,77,0,0,3,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0947-5745,1439-0469,,J ZOOL SYST EVOL RES,J.

Archiinocellia is assigned to Raphidiidae, sit. nov. The apparent absence of sclerotized gonocoxites 9 in the Archiinocellia protomaculata male is probably plesiomorphic at the family level. As some modern snakeflies do not require a cold interval to complete their development and Eocene Inocelliidae and Raphidiidae lived in regions of warm winters (especially A. protomaculata), adaptation to cold winters in many modern snakeflies is a post-Eocene phenomenon. Eocene Raphidiidae of Europe (Priabonian) differ greatly from those of North America (Ypresian and Priabonian). This pattern might reflect dispersal in either direction or ranges established prior to continental separation. Eocene Inocelliidae of Europe (Priabonian), however, are more similar to those of North America (Ypresian and Lutetian).","[Archibald, S.

Split-footed lacewings nowadays are restricted to Australasia, while fossil forms are also known from other areas of the world, indicating that the group was more species-rich and therefore likely diverse in the past. Split-footed lacewings have rather distinct larvae, roughly resembling antlion larvae, but differing from the latter especially with regard to the mandibles. Antlion larvae usually have three prominent teeth on each mandible, while at least extant larvae of split-footed lacewings only have a single prominent tooth per mandible. Fossils interpreted as larvae of split-footed lacewings are well known from amber from Myanmar (ca. 100 myr; Burmese amber) and by a single specimen from Baltic amber (about 40 myr). We here report additional fossil specimens from Myanmar amber, expanding the known record of fossil forms from six depicted specimens to 15. For the extant fauna, we could compile 25 larvae. We compare the diversity of shape of extant and fossil larvae through time using an outline analysis (based on elliptic Fourier transformation) of the head. The results of this analysis indicate that the morphological diversity, or disparity, of split-footed lacewing larvae was higher in the past than it is today. With this type of analysis, we can show a loss of diversity over time, without the necessity to identify the fossil larvae down to a narrow taxonomical range. A similar pattern has already been recognised in silky lacewings, Psychopsidae. This might indicate a general loss of diversity of lacewing larvae.","[Haug, Gideon T.; Haug, Carolin; van der Wal, Serita; Haug, Joachim T.] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen LMU Munich, Bioctr, Grosshaderner Str 2, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany; [Haug, Carolin; Haug, Joachim T.] GeoBio Ctr LMU, Richard Wagner Str 10, D-80333 Munich, Germany","Haug, JT (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen LMU Munich, Bioctr, Grosshaderner Str 2, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany.; Haug, JT (corresponding author), GeoBio Ctr LMU, Richard Wagner Str 10, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",joachim.haug@palaeo-evo-devo.info,,,Volkswagen FoundationVolkswagen; LMUexcellent Junior Researcher Fund; Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD)Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst (DAAD) [91693832]; LMU Munich,"We thank two anonymous reviewers and the Editor-in-Chief Mike Reich for helpful comments.

Representatives of Epicaridea (ingroup of Cymothoida) are parasitic on crustaceans and usually go through three distinct larval stages. The fossil record of Epicaridea is sparse and thus little is known about the palaeoecology and the origin of the complex life cycle of modern epicarideans. We present an assemblage of over 100 epicarideans preserved in a single piece of Late Cretaceous Myanmar amber. All individuals are morphologically similar to cryptoniscium stage larvae. The cryptoniscium stage usually constitutes the third and last larval stage. In modern representatives of Epicaridea, the cryptoniscium larvae are planktic and search for suitable host animals or adult females. These fossil specimens, though similar to some extant species, differ from other fossil epicaridean larvae in many aspects. Thus, a new species (and a new genus), Cryptolacruma nidis, is erected. Several factors can favour the preservation of multiple conspecific animals in a single piece of amber. However, the enormous density of epicarideans in the herein presented amber piece can only be explained by circumstances that result in high local densities of individuals, close to the resin-producing tree.","[Schaedel, Mario; Haug, Joachim T.] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Fac Biol, Grosshaderner Str 2, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany; [Hoernig, Marie K.] Ernst Moritz Arndt Univ Greifswald, Museum & Inst Zool, Cytol & Evolutionary Biol, Soldmannstr 23, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany; [Hyzny, Matus] Comenius Univ, Dept Geol & Paleontol, Ilkovicova 6, Bratislava 84215, Slovakia; [Haug, Joachim T.] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, GeoBio Ctr, Richard Wagner Str 10, D-80333 Munich, Germany","Schadel, M (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Fac Biol, Grosshaderner Str 2, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany.",mario.schaedel@palaeo-evo-devo.info; marie.hoernig@palaeo-evo-devo.info; matus.hyzny@uniba.sk; joachim.haug@palaeo-evo-devo.info,,,"Slovak Research and Development AgencySlovak Research and Development Agency [APVV-0436-12, /0042/18]; UNESCO-Amba/ MVTS of Presidium of the Slovak Academy of Sciences; Deutsche ForschungsgemeinschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [DFG 6300/3-2]; Volkswagen FoundationVolkswagen; Lichtenberg professorship; Deutsche ForschungsgesellschaftGerman Research Foundation (DFG) [Xradia XCT-200, DFG INST 292/119-1 FUGG, DFG INST 292/120-1 FUGG]","We thank Peter Vransky (ESISAS, ZISAS, FISAS Bratislava) for revealing the sample from his personal collection.

Two new species are erected within Buserphites n. gen.: B. applanatus, and B. myanmarensis; and five new species are established within Mesoserphites n. gen.: M. annulus, M. giganteus, M. engeli, M. scutatus, and M. viraneacapitis. These taxa show that the family Serphitidae was highly diverse in Burmese amber, adding substantially to recent discoveries within the endemic subfamily Supraserphitinae Rasnitsyn and O euro hm-Kuhnle. The presence of multiple serphitid genera in Burmese amber that are unknown from other amber deposits adds support to the idea that the Western Burma Block supported a fauna with multiple endemic groups as it approached contact with mainland Asia in the latest Albian or earliest Cenomanian. Despite the growing number of species recognized from Burmese amber, most of the newly described taxa are represented by very few specimens, suggesting that we are still within the early stages of documenting the fauna, or that the collections from this region represent a broader range of time and habitats than originally thought.

The new genus is characterized by two conspicuous autapomorphies, a triangular posterior extension of the head capsule and four large protuberances of the pronotum. Both structures can be interpreted as mechanic protective devices, but alternative/additional interpretations are possible. The large female subgenital plate is an autapomorphy of Dictyoptera. The transverse pronotal furrow suggests a placement in a dale with tAlienopteridae and Mantoclea. A close relationship between Latic-ephalana and Enervipmela is tentatively supported by a very narrow pronotum and relatively short antennae. The very broad head of Laticephalana with widely separated large compound eyes indicates predaceous habits, and the slender body and well-developed hindwings good flying abilities. The specializations of the distal legs, very similar to the conditions found in Alienopteridae, suggest a preference for the foliage of trees and shrubs. (C) 2021 The Geologists` Association.

Here, we describe a bizarre armoured planthopper nymph: Spinonympha shcherbakovi gen. et sp. nov. from mid-Cretaceous Kachin amber. The new genus and species is characterized by its large size, armoured body, extremely long rostrum, and leg structure. The fossil nymph cannot be attributed to any known planthopper family, but can be excluded from many families due to its large size and leg structure. The armoured body was probably developed for defence, and the extremely long rostrum indicates that, in the past, planthopper feeding on trees with thick and rough bark was more widespread than today. The new find reveals a new armoured morphotype previously unknown in planthopper nymphs. The fossil record of adult planthoppers is comparatively rich, but nymphs are rare and not well studied. Here, we describe a bizarre armoured planthopper nymph, Spinonympha shcherbakovi gen. et sp. nov., in mid-Cretaceous Kachin amber. The new genus is characterized by its large size, body armed with spines and tubercles, extremely long rostrum reaching well beyond the apex of the abdomen; profemur and mesofemur subcylindrical, covered with setae; protibia and mesotibia subquadrangular, densely covered with setae; protarsus and mesotarsus with two segments, tarsomere II longer and wider than I; metatrochanter swollen, metafemur subcylindrical, covered with short setae; metatibia subquadrangular, densely covered with short setae, without lateral spine and pectens without setae; metatarsus with three segments, and metatarsomere III extremely small. The fossil nymph cannot be attributed to any known planthopper family, but can be excluded from many families due to its large size and leg structure. The armoured body was probably developed for defence, and the extremely long rostrum indicates that, in the past, feeding on trees with thick and rough bark was more widespread than today.

This new genus is characterized by absence of spine or spine-like setae on ventral edge of protibia, well-developed recurrent humeral vein in the forewing, and well-developed hypocauda and pseudohypocauda in female genital segments. The peculiar combination of the morphological characters found in Paradoxoberotha gen. nov. cannot allow the definitive subfamilial placement within the currently recognized two subfamilies of Rhachiberothidae. This new species enhances knowledge on the morphological and species diversity of the Rhachiberothidae in the Cretaceous.","[Nakamine, Hiroshi] Minoh Pk Insect Museum, Minoh Pk 1-18, Osaka 5620002, Japan; [Yamamoto, Shuhei] Hokkaido Univ, Hokkaido Univ Museum, Kita Ku, Kita 10 Jo,Nishi 8 Chome, Sapporo, Hokkaido 0600810, Japan; [Takahashi, Yui] Keio Yochisha Elementary Sch, Shibuya Ku, Ebisu 2-35-1, Tokyo 1500013, Japan; [Li, Hongyu; Liu, Xingyue] China Agr Univ, Dept Entomol, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China","Nakamine, H (corresponding author), Minoh Pk Insect Museum, Minoh Pk 1-18, Osaka 5620002, Japan.; Liu, XY (corresponding author), China Agr Univ, Dept Entomol, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China.",nakamine.konchu@osaka.email.ne.jp; liuxingyue@cau.edu.cn,"; Liu, Xingyue/A-3019-2013; Yamamoto, Shuhei/U-8247-2018","Takahashi, Yui/0000-0003-2861-9940; Liu, Xingyue/0000-0002-9168-0659; Nakamine, Hiroshi/0000-0002-4640-2203; Yamamoto, Shuhei/0000-0002-4162-8457","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS), Tokyo, Japan [20J00159]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31972871]","We sincerely thank anonymous reviewers for their very useful comments on this manuscript.

Here, a new species of Burmacader is described under the name B. bicoloripennis sp. nov. as the fourth member of the genus from the same amber deposit. This new species is readily distinguished from the other three Burmacader species by the smaller body and the structures of the pronotum and hemelytron. The male genitalia of a fossil lace bug were observed for the first time in the new species. Furthermore, the segmental oligomery of the antenna in the fossil lace bug is reported for the first time. An identification key for all described species of Burmacader is provided. Our new finding sheds light on the structural similarity of the male genitalia between fossil and extant lace bugs and the hidden paleodiversity of this genus in the Late Mesozoic, indicating that Burmacader had already diversified by the mid-Cretaceous.

Here, we describe a new species based on an alate female preserved in 99-Ma Kachin amber -tZigrasimecia goldingot sp. nov. -which displays several diagnostic features shared with the known species of this genus. Such features include the peg-like mandibular setae, setae of the labrum, clypeal denticles, and an omega-shaped head capsule. Our findings suggest a high diversity among tZigrasimeciinae and support the grouping of this subfamily. Our work adds to the biodiversity of tZigrasimecia and tZigrasimeciinae, and explores the morphological and functional aspects, as well as the early appearance of the unique mouthparts in this ancient ant group.

Four of the snails belong to Cyclophoridae, and although their condition does not allow unambiguous identification or description of the species, one of them strongly resembles Archaeocyclotus plicatula Asato and Hirano in Hirano et al., 2019 from Kachin amber. The fifth snail, Euthema myanmarica n. sp. (Diplommatinidae), is a representative of a genus that was known exclusively from Kachin amber until now. The genus Euthema Yu, Wang, and Pan, 2018 is revised, with a new synonym, Xenostoma Bullis et al., 2020. The recently described 'Truncatellina dilatatus' Yu, 2020 from Kachin amber is placed in Euthema. A comparison of the distinguishing characters of the eight Euthema species is provided. The borings of bivalves in Hkamti amber correspond to the ichnospecies Teredolites clavatus Leymerie, 1842, associated with the bivalve genus Martesia Sowerby, 1824 (Pholadidae), and are common in Kachin amber. Similarity of the malacofauna from Hkamti and Kachin ambers, as well as the presence of numerous, similar Teredolites clavatus, indicates that these ambers were formed in very similar paleoenvironments. This indication suggests that forests with very similar conditions existed throughout the entire Albian to the early Cenomanian, or that the dating of at least one of these amber deposits is incorrect. In the latter case, it would mean that Kachin amber is at least 110 Ma or older.","[Balashov, Igor] II Schmalhausen Inst Zool, B Khmelnitsky Str 15, UA-01030 Kiev, Ukraine","Balashov, I (corresponding author), II Schmalhausen Inst Zool, B Khmelnitsky Str 15, UA-01030 Kiev, Ukraine.",igor_balashov@ukr.net,"Balashov, Igor/P-7655-2014","Balashov, Igor/0000-0002-2637-6941",,,,69,8,9,1,3,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0022-3360,1937-2337,,J PALEONTOL,J.

NOV.; INSECTA; BLATTODEA; DICTYOPTERA; PHYLOGENY; LEBANESE; NORTH; INDIA; GENUS,"Ectobiidae (= Blattelidae) is the most diverse extant cockroach family; it is cosmopolitan and includes several synanthropic species. Its Mesozoic record is scarce, with eleven species recorded from Brazil, Mongolia, China and Russia. Here, highly specialised taxa (characterised by a narrow hindwing remigium, unique specialised spines, permanent ootheca possession, narrow forewing radial area) are reported from mid-Cretaceous (Cenomanian) northern Myanmar amber: Caligoptera hinkelmani, gen. et sp. n., Latiblattella karlgruberi sp. n., Ectoovia protecta gen. et sp. n. The family Ectobiidae remained formally undescribed in previous research regarding Cretaceous amber. In C. hinkelmani, the venational pattern is similar to Perlucipecta WEI et REN, 2013 (Mesoblattinidae), but differ in the simple Sc, and simple straight M, ending at wing apex in the hindwing, characteristic for Ectobiidae. The presence of plumose spines on the forelegs is unique and has not been reported from any other cockroach group. L. karlgruberi assigned to the extant genus Latiblattella HEBARD, 1917, differs from congenerics only in the maculation of the forewing. Unfortunately, the terminalia of this species were not preserved. E. protecta differs from all other Ectobiidae in having a plesiomorphically divided subgenital plate and very narrow R on forewings, and is therefore classified in a newly erected subfamily. Four different subfamilies of the herein described species, including Piniblattellini VRSANSKY, 1997, evidence early diversification and paleogeographic distribution with lack of pattern. The permanent possession of an ootheca (described herein as Blattoothecichnus ectobiidaeus HINKELMAN, ichnosp. n.) alongside other diverse morphological adaptations of highly specialised taxa, wide biogeographic distribution and feeding specialisations might have contributed to their long existence, at least since the Cretaceous, until the family became dominant after the K-Pg extinction event.","[Sendi, Hemen] Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Dubravska Cesta 9, Bratislava 84506, Slovakia","Sendi, H (corresponding author), Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Dubravska Cesta 9, Bratislava 84506, Slovakia.",hemen.sendi@savba.sk,"Sendi, Hemen/ABG-1963-2021",,"Slovak Research and Development Agency [APVV-0436-12]; UNESCO-Amba/MVTS [VEGA 2/0042/18, VEGA 2/0139/17]","I would like to thank anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments, Jan Hinkelman (ZI SAS Bratislava) for provding an illustration, figure plate and (ichno)species description; Peter Vrsansky (SAS Bratislava) for advice and material and Lubomir Vidlicka (SAS Bratislava) for technical help.

The specimens differ in size; yet, they appear to be conspecific because of the profound morphological similarity. The fossils are interpreted as representatives of Isopoda, more precisely of the group Cymothoida, due to the presence of a triangular basipod of the uropod. Cymothoida comprises parasitic forms of Isopoda as well as many other types of feeding-habits. The morphology in the studied fossils suggests that they are not representatives of any of the parasitic ingroups of Cymothoida. Since there are no other findings of Isopoda from the Cretaceous with the same morphological features, the fossils at hand are described as a new species - Electrolana madelineae sp. nov. The smaller specimen lacks well-developed walking appendages on trunk segment seven; it can thus be interpreted as a manca stage (immature) individual. The systematic affinity and the functional morphology of the herein described fossils, as well as three seed shrimps (Ostracoda) in close proximity to one of the specimens, and the presence of pyrite in the amber piece points towards an aquatic lifestyle and a preservation in moist conditions. In addition, we review the fossil record of immature forms of Isopoda.","[Schaedel, Mario; Haug, Joachim T.] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Biol 2, Zoomorphol Grp, Grosshaderner Str 2, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany; [Hyzny, Matus] Comenius Univ, Dept Geol & Paleontol, Ilkovicova 6, Bratislava 84215, Slovakia; [Haug, Joachim T.] Ludwig Maximilian Univ Munchen, GeoBio Ctr, Richard Wagner Str 10, D-80333 Munich, Germany","Schadel, M (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Dept Biol 2, Zoomorphol Grp, Grosshaderner Str 2, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany.",mario.schaedel@gmail.com,,"Schadel, Mario/0000-0001-7945-4205; Hyzny, Matus/0000-0002-8960-2846",,,,142,2,3,0,2,SOC BRASILEIRA CARCINOLOGIA,RIO GRANDE RS,"LAB CRUSTACEA DOC FURG, AV ITALIA KM 8, CAIXA POSTAL 474, RIO GRANDE RS, CARREIROS 96201-900, BRAZIL",0104-6497,2358-2936,,NAUPLIUS,Nauplius,JAN 25,2021,29,,,,,,,,e2021003,10.1590/2358-2936e2021003,,,29,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Zoology,Marine & Freshwater Biology; Zoology,TT6QR,WOS:000680471600001,,gold,,,07/06/2022

In the present paper, three new soldier beetles, Cretocantharis veda gen. & sp. nov., Palaeocantharis panna gen. & sp. nov. and Hukawngichthyurus maha sp. nov. are reported. A phylogenetic reconstruction of Cantharidae, including all extant subfamilies and tribes, corroborates a distinct lineage comprising cantharinelike cantharids from Burmese amber as sister to Silini (Silinae), revealing that the current subfamilial placement is probably inadequate. Together with our results and recent molecular phylogenetic frameworks, it reveals that subfamilies of Cantharidae evolved during the Cretaceous period and highlights a probable Gondwanan ancestry of main cantharid groups. Our topology also proposes that the systematically controversial tribe Tytthonyxini of Silinae constitutes an independent clade sister to Malthininae, rather than the component of Silinae. Furthermore, Archaeomalthodes rosetta, previously placed in Malthininae, is recovered as a member of Dysmorphocerinae, representing the oldest fossil record for this subfamily and enhancing the Gondwanan origin hypothesis of Burmese amber biota. The previous interpretation of reticulated elytra as a lycid-mimicry for the Cretaceous cantharid fossils and pleisiomorphy of Cantharidae are challenged and discussed.","[Hsiao, Yun; Li, Yun] CSIRO, Australian Natl Insect Collect, GPO Box 1700, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Hsiao, Yun; Li, Yun] Australian Natl Univ, Res Sch Biol, Div Ecol & Evolut, Canberra, ACT 2601, Australia; [Ren, Dong] Capital Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China; [Ren, Dong] Capital Normal Univ, Acad Multidisciplinary Studies, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China; [Pang, Hong] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Ecol, State Key Lab Biocontrol, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China","Pang, H (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Ecol, State Key Lab Biocontrol, Guangzhou 510275, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",lsshpang@mail.sysu.edu.cn,,"Hsiao, Yun/0000-0003-2619-3296",Ministry of Science and Technology of China [2005DKA21402]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [31730087]; Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in University [IRT-17R75]; Support Project of High-level Teachers in Beijing Municipal Universities [IDHT20180518],"We are grateful to Dr Adam Slipinski (Australian National Insect Collection) for critical reading of the early version and MP analysis.

Amongst the 25 extant families of pseudoscorpions, only 14 are known from fossils, most of which are preserved in European ambers from the Eocene. Burmese amber from the Cenomanian (mid-Cretaceous) of northern Myanmar is an important source of Mesozoic pseudoscorpion fossils but only six species have been described from this amber to date. In this paper, we establish the first fossil record for the pseudoscorpion family Ideoroncidae Chamberlin, 1930, which is coequally the oldest record of the pseudoscorpion superfamily Neobisioidea. The new genus Proalbiorix is established for the two species P. gracilis sp. nov. and P. compactus sp. nov. which already show all diagnostic features of members belonging to this family to date. Interestingly, Proalbiorix shows morphological features that align the fossils with present-day fauna from the Americas and Africa rather than Asia, which has biogeographical implications. Overall, the description provides another example of relative morphological stasis of pseudoscorpions compared to other arachnid lineages such as spiders, and that all major clades of pseudoscorpions were established long before the Cretaceous.

However, camouflage has only rarely been reported in the fossil record. Here we report findings of four bark lice preserved in 100 Million year old amber from Myanmar, which represent the first fossil evidence for masking behaviour in Cretaceous representatives of Psocodea. All four of these, probably not conspecific, and immature bark lice carry sand granules and organic material atop their back, which probably resulted in camouflaging them against the background (e.g. bark) to avoid detection by predators. We briefly summarise concepts of camouflage and examples of decoration behaviour within insects, as well as possible receiver (i.e. predators) of the camouflage of the herein described bark lice. The exact phylogenetic position of the specimens remains unclear, due to the scarce fossil record of Cretaceous immatures of Psocodea, as well as extant immatures. This demonstrates the importance of findings as reported here, as a wide knowledge of morphology and development of a certain group is crucial to get an insight into their evolution and reconstructing environments in deep time.","[Kiesmueller, Christine; Hoernig, Marie K.] Univ Greifswald, Zool Inst & Museum, Cytol & Evolutionary Biol, Soldmannstr 23, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany; [Haug, Joachim T.] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Biol 2, Bictr, Grosshaderner Str 2, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany; [Haug, Joachim T.] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, GeoBio Ctr, Richard Wagner Str 10, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Mueller, Patrick] Kreuzbergstr 90, D-66482 Zweibrucken, Germany","Kiesmuller, C (corresponding author), Univ Greifswald, Zool Inst & Museum, Cytol & Evolutionary Biol, Soldmannstr 23, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany.",christine.kiesmueller@palaeo-evo-devo.info,"Kiesmller, Christine/AGW-1235-2022","Kiesmller, Christine/0000-0002-4961-6565; Hornig, Marie K./0000-0002-0401-2282",Landesgraduiertenforderung MV; Volkswagen Foundation,"CK is kindly funded by the Landesgraduiertenforderung MV.

Its wing venation and body characters lead us to emend the diagnosis of the family Burmorussidae. Cretorussus vilhelmseni gen. et sp. nov. is considered to be a specialized parasitic wa sp of wood-living hosts because of the orussid-like ocellar crown, antennae attachedwell above clypeus, and antennal grooves absent. Interestingly, the third tarsomere carries a prominent lanceolate lobe, serving as part of the host detection. We propose a summary of the orussoid fossil diversity. Lastly, we discuss the implications of several characters of Burmorussidae that are involved in host detection. (C) 2021 The Geologists' Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This land snail possesses intermediate characters between the latter group and some other families of Cyclophoroidea. The shell of B. artiukhini is relatively high and has 8.5 whorls, which places it more closely to known genera of Pupinidae. But it differs from all other genera of the family by the oblique aperture and relatively wide conical shell, the characters common in many Cyclophoridae, Neocyclotidae and Alycaeidae. It means that B. artiukhini is possibly representing a morphological group that was ancestral to all other Pupinidae and, therefore, was transitional between this family and other Cyclophoroidea.

Here we review the Mesozoic fossil record of Sphindi-dae and report a new sphindid genus and species, Trematosphindus newtoni gen. et sp. nov., from Albian/Cenomanian amber from northern Myanmar (ca. 99 Ma). Trematosphindus is set apart from all other sphindids by the presence of distinct lateral cavities on the anterior pronotal angles. Our phylogenetic analysis identifies Trematosphindus as an early-diverging genus within Sphindidae, sister to the remainder of the family except Protosphindus, or Protosphindus and Odontosphindus. The new fossils provide evidence that basal crown slime mold beetles begun to diversify by the mid-Cretaceous, providing a valuable calibration point for understanding timescale of sphindid co-evolution with slime molds.","[Li, Yan-Da; Huang, Di-Ying; Cai, Chen-Yang] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Li, Yan-Da; Huang, Di-Ying; Cai, Chen-Yang] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Tihelka, Erik; Cai, Chen-Yang] Univ Bristol, Sch Earth Sci, Life Sci Bldg,Tyndall Ave, Bristol BS8, Avon, England; [Liu, Zhen-Hua] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Coll Ecol & Evolut, Key Lab Biodivers Dynam & Conservat Guangdong Hig, State Key Lab Biocontrol,Sch Life Sci, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Liu, Zhen-Hua] CSIRO Natl Res Collect Australia, Australian Natl Insect Collect, Canberra, ACT, Australia","Cai, CY (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China.; Cai, CY (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China.; Cai, CY (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Sch Earth Sci, Life Sci Bldg,Tyndall Ave, Bristol BS8, Avon, England.",cycai@nigpas.ac.cn,,"Li, Yan-Da/0000-0002-9439-202X","Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research project [2019QZKK0706]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB26000000, XDB18000000]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41688103]","We are grateful to Richard A.

The former differs from other genera of the family in the extremely small size, sharply triangular subgenital plate and tubular ovipositor. S. magnoculara is autapomorphic in having extremely elongated antennae (with ca. 140 segments), pronotum more elongated, less circular, elongated wings, and distinctly larger size (12.06 mm), while S. delicata has a unique long antennae (with ca. at least 70 segments), and a triangular pronotum. A morphologically based phylogenetic reconstruction reveal that Nocticolidae and Latindiinae form a clade (97 % support in the consensus and bootstrap analyses, 98.4 % in the Bayesian network tree), with Stavba VRSANSKA et VRSANSKY, 2019 in VRSANSKY et al. (2019)) (Liberiblattinidae) being paraphyletic with respect to them. Their sister clade includes all species of Stavba, except basal S. delicata and S. magnoculara, revealing 90 % support in both consensus and bootstrap analysis, and 79 % in the Bayesian network tree). Crenocticola LI et HUANG, 2019 was insignificantly posed as sister taxon with respect to the Stavba clade in the Bayesian network tree, while in other analyses Crenocticola is housed in a polytomy within Nocticolidae. M. libera is one of the most miniaturised fossil cockroaches with a body length of about 3-3.5 mm. Considerable structural changes related to miniaturisation include allometric reductions and simplifications in Bauplan (reduced venation, supported costa, wings with thick veins, oligomerised cerci). The ovipositor is long compared to the rest of the body. Very small morphotypes also occur in many extant cavernicolous Nocticolidae, myrmecophilous Attaphila WHEELER, 1900 and extinct beetle-like Umenocoleoidea (also in Anaplectinae WALKER, 1868, Prosoplecta SAUSSURE, 1864, and Permoponopterix NEL et al., 2014), indicating that miniaturisation occurred independently in these lineages. Miniaturisation and/or associated change of diet (towards fungivory and algaeovory) or predation pressure might have represented an ancestral preadaptation of Nocticolidae resulting in the invasion of caves.","[Sendi, Hemen] Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Dubravska Cesta 9, Bratislava 84506, Slovakia","Sendi, H (corresponding author), Slovak Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Dubravska Cesta 9, Bratislava 84506, Slovakia.",hemen.sendi@savba.sk,"Sendi, Hemen/ABG-1963-2021",,Slovak Research and Development Agency [APVV-0436-12]; UNESCO-Amba/MVTS of Presidium of the Slovak Academy of Sciences [VEGA 2/0042/18],"I would like to thank the two anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments, Dany AZAR (LU Beirut), Patrick MULLER (private, Germany), and Bo WANG (NIGPAS Nanjing) for providing the rare material and Peter VRSANSKY (ESISAS Bratislava) for providing the rare material and for advice.

They have very distinct larvae, roughly resembling antlion larvae, yet, in many larvae the neck region is extremely elongated, earning them the name 'long-necked antlions'. Fossil lacewing larvae with recognisably long necks, but other characters differing from those of extant long-necked lacewing larvae, are known from Myanmar amber (100 mya, Burmese amber). We here summarise all already known larvae of extant thread-winged lacewings (53 specimens) and fossils of lacewing larvae with long necks (8 specimens). Moreover, we add further extant larvae of thread-winged lacewings (4 specimens) and fossil lacewing larvae with long necks (5 specimens), providing us a dataset of 70 specimens representing two distinct time slices. We compared these larvae concerning their shape by using outline analysis (based on elliptic Fourier transformation), including shape of the mandibles, the head, the neck, the trunk and the overall body shape. Fossil long-necked lacewing larvae differ from modern long-necked lacewing larvae especially in mandible and trunk shape. Their preservation in amber indicates that these larvae had a different ecology from their modern counterparts, which occur in sandy, arid environments. It remains unclear whether the fossil long-necked larvae are closely related to Crocinae. In any case these fossils represent a now extinct type of morphology, and most likely ecology.","[Haug, Gideon T.; Baranov, Viktor; Pazinato, Paula G.; Haug, Carolin; Haug, Joachim T.] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen LMU Munich, Bioctr, Grasshaderner Str 2, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany; [Wizen, Gil] 602-52 Pk St E, Mississauga, ON L5G 1M1, Canada; [Mueller, Patrick] Kreuzbergstr 90, D-66482 Zweibrucken, Germany; [Haug, Carolin; Haug, Joachim T.] LMU, GeoBio Ctr, Richard Wagner Str 10, D-80333 Munich, Germany","Haug, JT (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen LMU Munich, Bioctr, Grasshaderner Str 2, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany.; Haug, JT (corresponding author), LMU, GeoBio Ctr, Richard Wagner Str 10, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",joachim.haug@palaeo-evo-devo.info,,,"Volkswagen Foundation; Lichtenberg Professorship; LMUexcellent Junior Researcher Fund; LMU Munich; Capes/Doctoral Program (CAPES/DAAD/CNPQ) [88887.161379/2017-00, 15-2017]","This study benefited from the support of various institutions and persons.

The evolutionary history of the megadiverse order Coleptera, which has a great diversity of mouthparts and feeding strategies, is well documented since early Permian with a significant peak in diversity in the Triassic. Currently, however, there is no evidence that in the Mesozoic these beetles fed on nectar despite the recorded specializations for pollination of flowering plants in several families since the mid-Cretaceous. Results Here we describe a new wedge-shaped beetle Melanosiagon serraticornis gen. et sp. nov. from mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber attributed to Macrosiagonini (Ripiphoridae: Ripiphorinae), which has elongated galea comparable to that in the extant parasitoid genus Macrosiagon, and a well known example of adaptation for nectar feeding in Coleoptera. Furthermore, Salignacicola gen. nov. is established for Macrosiagon ebboi Perrichot, Nel et Neraudeau, 2004, based on the holotype found in mid-Cretaceous amber from France. Systematic positions of both newly established genera are discussed. A list of potential wasp and bee hosts of Ripiphorinae from the Mesozoic is provided. Conclusions This study presents evidence of the earliest occurrence of specialized nectar feeding mouthparts in Coleoptera. Melanosiagon serraticornis is closely related to extant Macrosiagonini. In all genera belonging to subfamily Ripiphorinae the primary larvae are adapted for parasitism on aculeate Hymenoptera (bees and wasps) and adults are associated with blossoms of flowering plants, in terms of their specialized morphology. Adults of Macrosiagon visit blossoms of flowering plants to obtain nectar and lay eggs from which the hatching larvae attack visiting wasps and bees. An association with flowers of some tropical trees is already corroborated in some extant species. Interestingly the larvae of Ripiphorinae are also found in Burmese amber. Thus, both life stages of the mid-Cretaceous Ripiphorinae indicate a close association of this lineage with flowering trees.","[Batelka, Jan; Prokop, Jakub] Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, Vinicna 7, Prague 12800 2, Czech Republic","Batelka, J (corresponding author), Charles Univ Prague, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, Vinicna 7, Prague 12800 2, Czech Republic.",janbat@centrum.cz,"Prokop, Jakub/B-1432-2008","Prokop, Jakub/0000-0001-6996-7832",Grant Agency of the Czech Republic [21-05216S],Both authors acknowledge the financial support of the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic (No. 21-05216S).,,63,0,1,4,4,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,2730-7182,,BMC ECOL EVOL,BMC Ecol.

In this study, we describe four Mid-Cretaceous (approx. 99 Ma) amber specimens from northern Myanmar with an adult female, part of an egg sac and some spiderlings of the extinct family Lagonomegopidae preserved, which suggest that adult lagonomegopid females probably built and then guarded egg sacs in their retreats or nests, and the hatched spiderlings may have stayed together with their mother for some time. The new fossils represent early evidence of maternal care in fossil spiders, and enhance our understanding of the evolution of this behaviour.","[Guo, Xiangbo; Selden, Paul A.; Ren, Dong] Capital Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, 105 Xisanhuanbeilu, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China; [Guo, Xiangbo; Selden, Paul A.; Ren, Dong] Capital Normal Univ, Acad Multidisciplinary Studies, 105 Xisanhuanbeilu, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China; [Selden, Paul A.] Univ Kansas, Dept Geol, 1414 Naismith Dr, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA; [Selden, Paul A.] Nat Hist Museum, Cromwell Rd, London SW7 5BD, England","Selden, PA; Ren, D (corresponding author), Capital Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, 105 Xisanhuanbeilu, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China.; Selden, PA; Ren, D (corresponding author), Capital Normal Univ, Acad Multidisciplinary Studies, 105 Xisanhuanbeilu, Beijing 100048, Peoples R China.; Selden, PA (corresponding author), Univ Kansas, Dept Geol, 1414 Naismith Dr, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.; Selden, PA (corresponding author), Nat Hist Museum, Cromwell Rd, London SW7 5BD, England.",selden@ku.edu; rendong@mail.cnu.edu.cn,,"Selden, Paul/0000-0001-7454-4260","National Natural Science Foundation of China [31730087, 32020103006]",This research is supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant nos. 31730087 and 32020103006).,,59,1,2,1,3,ROYAL SOC,LONDON,"6-9 CARLTON HOUSE TERRACE, LONDON SW1Y 5AG, ENGLAND",0962-8452,1471-2954,,P ROY SOC B-BIOL SCI,Proc.

In the present study we explored the mesosoma of Platygastroidea and found two new synapomorphies for Platygastridae: an externally visible anterior mesofurcal pit, which corresponds to an invagination that connects to the anterior portion of the mesofurca, and internally, a posteriorly shifted origin of the first wing flexors. The absence of a mesofurcal bridge and the exclusively mesopectal origin of the fore wing flexors are treated as synapomorphies for Platygastridae+Janzenellidae.

This new taxon prompts discussion of the current classification and phylogeny of the family, which remains widely unexplored, and of the evaluation of the placement of two older cixiid fossils currently known, Karebodopoides aptianus (Fennah, 1987) and Cixius petrinus Fennah, 1961. A new genus, Barremixius Bourgoin & Szwedo gen. nov., is proposed for the latter, resulting in the new combination Barremixius petrinus (Fennah, 1987). Karebodopoides Szwedo, 2001 and Barremixius gen. nov. are provisionally recognized as the oldest Cixiidae, respectively representative of the oecleinian lineage (including Bothriocerini trib. stat. nov.) and of the cixiinian lineage.

Some Albian-Cenomanian ambers preserve elements of a diverse biota that existed during the rise of angiosperms, a time of fundamental change in terrestrial ecosystems that likely affected epiphytic taxa. Recent analyses have provided important insight into the phylogenetic diversification and morphological evolution of liverworts. They suggest that the mid-to Late Cretaceous was a transitional time with a significant species turnover. Here, we review all currently recognized leafy liverwort species from Cretaceous ambers based on the examination of previously described fossil specimens as well as newly discovered amber inclusions. Our survey includes a determination key. The study of 26 new fossils from Kachin amber, including fertile material, enabled us to emend descriptions for Frullania cretacea, F. baerlocheri, and Protofrullania cornigera. Mid-Cretaceous Frullaniaceae often possess some characters and character combinations that are absent in extant representatives, substantiating the assumption of a lineage turnover in the Cretaceous. Among the new fossils is Radula heinrichsii sp. nov., which expands the number of Cretaceous, amber-preserved liverwort species to eight. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

However, moss fossils which could substantiate these findings are gener-ally rare in the Cretaceous. In this study, we investigate several sterile gametophyte fragments of mosses pre-served in mid-Cretaceous Kachin amber from Myanmar. We describe a new sterile shoot as Vetiplanaxis obtusus sp. nov. (Hypnodendrales), make an emended description of V. pyrrhobryoides Bell based on additional fossil materials, and identify a linear-lanceolate leaf as V. cf. longiacuminatus Hedenas et al. We confirm again the presence of geminate teeth in leaf margin of the above three species studied here, and report the presence of hair-like rhizoids in stem. The phyllotaxis in the species of Vetiplanaxis with complanate shoot is explained as pseudo-tetrastichous, really octostichous, formed by two right-handed Fibonacci spirals. Our findings provide new insights into the circumscription of the Cretaceous moss genus Vetiplanaxis, and add new evidence to indi-cate that there was a diverse pleurocarpous moss flora in the mid-Cretaceous Kachin amber forest of Myanmar.

However, we caution to take this interpretation for granted because of the still incomplete assessment of the plant diversity preserved in the Kachin amber in-clusions. Our re-examination of the plant fossils regarded as models for Phyllochrysa huangi received evidence for a new species of the lycophyte genus Selaginella, namely S. cretacea sp. nov., and two indeterminate species of Selaginella, besides four species of the leafy liverwort family Frullaniaceae, including Frullania baerlocheri, F. kachinensis, F. partita, and Protofrullania cornigera. Careful morpholog-ical comparison recovered that the flat larvae of Phyllochrysa huangi closely match the dorsiventrally complanate strobili of Selaginella subgenus Stachygynandrum (lycophytes) represented by S. cretacea sp. nov. In turn, the larval morphology did not show obvious similarities with the shoots of the leafy liv-erworts. In the context of the improved taxonomic survey of the plant inclusions, it is evident that the so-called liverwort mimesis in Cretaceous lacewing larvae was actually lycophyte mimesis. The larvae of Phyllochrysa huangi provided the earliest evidence of a putative extinct Phyllochrysa-Selaginella mimetic system.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Wing venation suggests attribution to Panorpidium mainly on developed ScP (with six branches), three longitudinal branches between basal part of RP and CuA thorn CuPaa, and area between MP and anal edge of tegmen narrow. Body morphologies exhibit similarity to Burmelcana including metatibia with pairs of spine-like spurs in distal half, metatibia with three apical spurs, and metabasitarsus with a row of stout spines on ventral margin. Thereby the combined characters of Panorpidium maculosum sp. nov., including body structures and wing venation, indicate that Burmelcana and Panorpidium belong to one genus and Burmelcana is junior homonym name of Panorpidium. Additionally, the new species distinguishes from the species of Panorpidium mainly by metathoracic basitarsus with a row of stout spines on distal half and area between MP and anal edge of tegmen narrow with oblique and netted crossveins, and is erected as a new species.

Therefore, it should be surprising that these immatures are often not considered to the same extent as the adult beetles. As an example, the fossil record of most beetle groups is largely represented by adult specimens. Representatives of Mordellidae, the group of tumbling flower beetles, have a cosmopolitan distribution with myriads of formally described species, based mostly on adult male specimens. Mordellidae is also well represented in the fossil record, but again only by adults; not a single fossil specimen of a larva has been reported until now. We report a new well-preserved beetle larva in 99 million-year-old Kachin amber. The larva possesses specialisations not known from the modern larvae of Mordellidae, but otherwise is clearly similar to them in many aspects. It appears possible that the fossil represents yet another holometabolan larva in Kachin amber that is associated with life within wood and/or fungi, and therefore, may have contributed to carbon cycling of the past.","[Zippel, Ana; Haug, Carolin; Haug, Joachim T.] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Bioctr, Grosshaderner Str 2, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany; [Haug, Carolin; Haug, Joachim T.] LMU, GeoBio Ctr, Richard Wagner Str 10, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Mueller, Patrick] Kreuzbergstr 90, D-66482 Zweibrucken, Germany","Zippel, A (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Bioctr, Grosshaderner Str 2, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany.",ana.zippel@palaeo-evo-devo.info,,"Zippel, Ana/0000-0002-6509-4445",Projekt DEAL,Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.,,73,2,2,0,0,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",0031-0220,1867-6812,,PALZ,PalZ,JUN,2022,96,2,,,,,219,229,,10.1007/s12542-022-00608-8,,MAR 2022,11,Paleontology,Paleontology,1R8RR,WOS:000763201400002,,hybrid,,,07/06/2022

Here, we figure and describe a new brachypsectrid species from the mid-Cretaceous amber of northern Myanmar, based on an exceptionally well-preserved female specimen. Although sexual dimorphism is common in Brachypsectridae, this specimen is recognized as a new species, rather than a female of the previously reported V. burmitica, primarily based on its different pedicel-scape attachment. A new species, Vetubrachypsectra huchengi Li, Kundrata & Cai sp. nov., is described from mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber on the basis of a single adult female. The species is assigned to genus Vetubrachypsectra Qu & Cai based on its serrate antennae, long maxillary palps, presence of tibial spurs, and elytra without clear striae. Vetubrachypsectra huchengi differs distinctly from V. burmitica Qu & Cai, the only other species in the genus, in having the pedicel apically attached to the scape. Some other differences between the female of V. huchengi and the male of V. burmitica include less serrate antennae, a broader pronotal disc, a broader scutellar shield and smaller tibial spurs. However, at least some of these characters can be considered sexually dimorphic.","[Li, Yan-Da; Huang, Di-Ying; Cai, Chen-Yang] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Palaeoenvironm, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Kundrata, Robin] Palacky Univ, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, Olomouc 77146, Czech Republic; [Qu, Tian-Quan] China Univ Geosci, State Key Lab Biogeol & Environm Geol, Wuhan 430078, Peoples R China; [Cai, Chen-Yang] Univ Bristol, Sch Earth Sci, Life Sci Bldg,Tyndall Ave, Bristol BS8 1TQ, Avon, England","Cai, CY (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Palaeoenvironm, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China.; Cai, CY (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Sch Earth Sci, Life Sci Bldg,Tyndall Ave, Bristol BS8 1TQ, Avon, England.",ydli@nigpas.ac.cn; robin.kundrata@upol.cz; qtq@cug.edu.cn; dyhuang@nigpas.ac.cn; cycai@nigpas.ac.cn,,"Kundrata, Robin/0000-0001-9397-1030; Li, Yan-Da/0000-0002-9439-202X",,,,20,0,0,3,3,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-4450,,INSECTS,Insects,FEB,2022,13,2,,,,,,,122,10.3390/insects13020122,,,8,Entomology,Entomology,ZJ1DA,WOS:000762051100001,35206695,"Green Published, gold",,,07/06/2022

Ingensala gen. nov. is superficially similar to Eofulgoridium regarding its venation pattern, rather than to the Inoderbidae type genus Inoderbe, and further confirmed that Inoderbidae might descend from the Jurassic planthopper family Fulgoridiidae. The early fork of CuA and the stem CuA bearing many branches also can be found in Jurassic Qiyangiricaniidae and Eocene Weiwoboidae. Ingensala gen. nov. also superficially resembles some Tropiduchidae: Tropiduchinae. The new genus differs from the type genus Inoderbe to a large extent according to its wide head, frons without fastigium, antennae not so elongate, the tectiform condition of wings' position in repose, large, broad and translucent tegmen, triangular basal cell, single CuA(1), legs covered with short setae, and the lack of filamentous wax on body. Therefore, two new subfamilies (Inoderbinae stat. nov. and Ingensalinae subfam. nov.) are established for these two genera respectively. The diversification in planthoppers could be the result of pressure of environmental changes during the mid-Cretaceous, and Inoderbidae provides more information for us to understand the Cretaceous stage of Fulgoroidea evolution and diversification.","[Luo, Cihang; Liu, Xiaojing; Jarzembowski, Edmund A.] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Luo, Cihang; Liu, Xiaojing; Jarzembowski, Edmund A.] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Luo, Cihang] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Song, Zhishun] Jiangsu Second Normal Univ, Inst Insect Resources & Biodivers, Sch Life Sci Chem & Chem Engn, Nanjing 210013, Peoples R China; [Liu, Xiaojing] Yangtze Univ, Sch GeoSci, Wuhan 430100, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Thin] China Univ Geosci Beijing, State Key Lab Biogeol & Environm Geol, Beijing 100083, Peoples R China; [Szwedo, Jacek] Univ Gdansk, Fac Biol, Dept Invertebrate Zool & Parasitol, Lab Evolutionary Entomol, 59 Wita Stwosza St, PL-80308 Gdansk, Poland; [Szwedo, Jacek] Univ Gdansk, Fac Biol, Dept Invertebrate Zool & Parasitol, Museum Amber Inclus, 59 Wita Stwosza St, PL-80308 Gdansk, Poland","Luo, CH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China.; Luo, CH (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China.; Luo, CH (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",chluo@nigpas.ac.cn,"Szwedo, Jacek/O-1442-2019","Szwedo, Jacek/0000-0002-2796-9538; Luo, Cihang/0000-0002-4855-6185","National Natural Science Foundation of China [42125201, 41688103, 31970442]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB26000000]; Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research [2019QZKK0706]; Chinese Academy of Sciences under the President's International Fellowship Initiative (PIFI)","This research has been supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant nos. 42125201, 41688103, and 31970442), the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (XDB26000000), and the Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research (2019QZKK0706).

The order has a fragmentary fossil record but has left a rich, albeit hitherto undocumented, fossil legacy in mid-Cretaceous amber from Myanmar, also called Burmese amber or Burmite. Here, we review a large series of schizomids from this type of amber and propose four new genera for seven new species. In addition, we include a short revision of all schizomid genera based on 14 morphological characters. Although none of the fossils can be assigned to Recent genera, they resemble the modern fauna in general morphology and highlight relative morphological stasis in this arachnid order. The fossils show a general trend towards eye reduction, but some of the specimens retain corneate eyes. Comparative data suggest affinities of the fossils with the Recent Old World fauna rather than American relatives. Furthermore, the fossils provide evidence for a Gondwanan origin of the Burma Terrane. Overall, the data suggest a high diversity at both species and genus levels for Burmese amber schizomids. We discuss potential reasons for this richness that will probably necessitate the description of additional genera and species in future studies.","[Magnussen, Ilian De Francesco; Mueller, Sandro P.; Kotthoff, Ulrich] Univ Hamburg, Inst Geol, Bundesstr 55, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Magnussen, Ilian De Francesco; Kotthoff, Ulrich] Leibniz Inst Anal Biodivers Change LIB Hamburg, Ctr Biomonitoring, Bundesstr 55, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Magnussen, Ilian De Francesco; Mueller, Sandro P.; Harms, Danilo] Leibniz Inst Anal Biodivers Change LIB Hamburg, Ctr Taxon & Morphol, Zool Museum Hamburg, Martin Luther King Pl 3, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany; [Hammel, Joerg U.] Helmholtz Zentrum Hereon, Inst Mat Phys, Max Planck Str 1, D-21502 Geesthacht, Germany","Magnussen, ID (corresponding author), Univ Hamburg, Inst Geol, Bundesstr 55, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.; Magnussen, ID (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Anal Biodivers Change LIB Hamburg, Ctr Biomonitoring, Bundesstr 55, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.; Magnussen, ID (corresponding author), Leibniz Inst Anal Biodivers Change LIB Hamburg, Ctr Taxon & Morphol, Zool Museum Hamburg, Martin Luther King Pl 3, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany.",ilian.de.francesco.magnussen@gmail.com,,,"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [HA 8785/5-1, KO 3944/10-1]","The study was financially supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG), grant numbers HA 8785/5-1 and KO 3944/10-1.",,62,0,0,0,0,OXFORD UNIV PRESS,OXFORD,"GREAT CLARENDON ST, OXFORD OX2 6DP, ENGLAND",0024-4082,1096-3642,,ZOOL J LINN SOC-LOND,Zool.

Most belong to extinct families already well known or newly described, but few are related to existing families and for which these fossils will prove to be very useful for future molecular calibration analyzes. Here, we describe a new fossil genus of the extant Cixiidae family that we place into the recently described fossil tribe Acrotiarini. A new key to genera identification of Acrotiarini is proposed. Allowing the description for the first time of the male genitalia of Acrotiarini, this new fossil genus broadens the knowledge of the fossil tribe, and it underlines the already great diversity of the Cixiidae in the Cretaceous. A new Burmese amber genus Maculixius gen. nov. with its type species Maculixius jiewenae sp. nov. is described in the planthopper family Cixiidae. This new genus is unique in Burmese Cixiidae by its forewing venation, with Pcu and A1 merging in the middle of clavus, the late bifurcation of ScP+R slightly after this level, and the early CuA forking well before this level. Although the head capsule is missing, it belongs to the recently described tribe Acrotiarini, based on the pentacarinated mesonotum and the distinctly arched RA on forewing with cell C1 wider submedially than apically. Morphological characteristics of Acrotiarini are discussed, and a key to identification of Acrotiarini genera is provided. The new taxon broadens the knowledge of the tribe, and it underlines the already great diversity of the family in the Cretaceous.","[Wang, Menglin] China West Normal Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Southwest China Wildlife Resources Conser, Nanchong 637009, Peoples R China; [Liang, Feiyang] Hunan Univ Sci & Technol, Key Lab Econ Crops Genet Improvement & Integrated, Xiangtan 411201, Peoples R China; [Bourgoin, Thierry] Sorbonne Univ, EPHE Univ, CNRS,ISYEB,MNHN, UMR 7205,Inst Systemat,Evolut,Biodiversite, F-75005 Paris, France","Wang, ML (corresponding author), China West Normal Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Southwest China Wildlife Resources Conser, Nanchong 637009, Peoples R China.",wangmenglin123@126.com; feiyang_sco@foxmail.com; thierry.bourgoin@mnhn.fr,"Bourgoin, Thierry/L-5146-2019","Bourgoin, Thierry/0000-0001-9277-2478; LIANG, Feiyang/0000-0001-9757-5457",,,,25,0,0,2,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-4450,,INSECTS,Insects,JAN,2022,13,1,,,,,,,102,10.3390/insects13010102,,,9,Entomology,Entomology,ZB7TN,WOS:000757040200001,35055944,"Green Published, gold",,,07/06/2022

Two new species, A. qizhihaoi sp. nov. and A. xiafangyuani sp. nov. are described in the genus, the former species based on a singleton male and the latter on what likely is a male. The two new species are distinguished from other described lucanid fossil species by: antenna geniculate, body slender, elytra with longitudinal grooves, and mandibles asymmetrical. A key is given to distinguish the new genus from other amber genera of Lucanidae. The new genus is considered to be morphologically most similar to the extant genus Figulus Macleay, 1819, but is easily separated by tabulated features. Based on the age of the fossils combined with their morphological features, we suggest that the Lucaninae appeared and began to diversify before the Late Cretaceous, and the decomposition of rotten wood, which was assisted by the stag beetle larvae, contributed to the nutrient circulation and development of forest ecosystems at that time.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Consequently, it is an invaluable source of information for taxonomic and evolutionary studies. Moreover, it forms a unique connection between the Jurassic and Cretaceousfaunas and documents the first representatives of modern genera. In this paper, a primitive genus of Keroplatidae, Paleoplatyura Meunier, 1899, is recorded from Burmese amber for the first time. This represents a rather rare case of the presence of an extant insect genus in the Mesozoic. Three new species of Paleoplatyura are described, indicating that this genus was relatively diverse already in the Cretaceous. Three new species of Paleoplatyura Meunier, 1899, i.e., Paleoplatyura agnieszkae sp. nov., P. miae sp. nov., and P. magnifica sp. nov., are described and figured. The concept of the genus is briefly discussed, and its systematic position is clarified. A key to fossil species is provided. The genus Paleoplatyura is described from the Eocene Baltic amber. It is concluded that, in Baltic amber, this group is represented only by the type species, and the identity of the other two species is problematic. No additional specimens have been found so far in this amber. Therefore, the presence of as many as three new species in Burmese amber, certainly belonging to Paleoplatyura, is a confirmation of its occurrence already in the Mesozoic.","[Sevcik, Jan] Univ Ostrava, Fac Sci, Dept Biol & Ecol, Chittussiho 10, Ostrava 710 00, Czech Republic; [Krzeminski, Wieslaw; Skibinska, Kornelia] Evolut Anim Polish Acad Sci, Inst Systemat, PL-31016 Krakow, Poland","Skibinska, K (corresponding author), Evolut Anim Polish Acad Sci, Inst Systemat, PL-31016 Krakow, Poland.",sevcikjan@hotmail.com; wieslawk4@gmail.com; yukisiak@gmail.com,"Sevcik, Jan/D-7307-2014","Krzeminski, Wieslaw/0000-0001-5685-891X; Skibinska, Kornelia/0000-0002-5971-9373; Sevcik, Jan/0000-0001-7174-593X",,,,36,0,1,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-4450,,INSECTS,Insects,JAN,2022,13,1,,,,,,,24,10.3390/insects13010024,,,9,Entomology,Entomology,YN4DK,WOS:000747209800001,35055867,"Green Published, gold",,,07/06/2022

Here we present fossils of the new species Gryllobencain patrickmuelleri n. gen., n. sp. from Myanmar amber that possess an overall orthopteroid morphology, hence resemble crickets. Unlike in most crickets, thorax appendages 1 and 2 (legs) are large and prominent, even in comparison to thorax appendage 3. Furthermore, thorax appendages 1 and 2 are able to fold against themselves and are armed with prominent spine-like setae, indicating that these legs were originally used for grasping prey. Most prominent is a large spine on the tibia of both appendages distantly reminding of the tibial spur or claw of praying mantises. Comparable prey-catching apparatuses have evolved repeatedly in the group Polyneoptera: gladiators (Mantophasmatodea), three ingroups of bush-crickets (Saginae, Austrosaginae, Listroscelidinae) as well as one species of fossil mantises (Santanmantis axelrodi Grimaldi, 2003) appear to have used thorax appendages 1 and 2 for prey catching. The new fossils do not seem to be closely related to any of these groups. They differ especially by prominent cerci equipped with numerous, probably mechano-sensorial setae. In the other five groups, the cerci are significantly smaller, often indistinct. The fossils furthermore have prominent maxillae with sickle-shaped proximal parts and well-armed large palps, indicating that the maxillae played an important role in processing the prey. While the thorax appendages hence represent a case of clear convergent evolution, the uniqueness of the feeding apparatus leads us to recognise the fossils as a highly specialised new species.","[Haug, Joachim T.; Pazinato, Paula G.; Baranov, Viktor; Haug, Carolin] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Fac Biol, Grosshaderner Str 2, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany; [Haug, Joachim T.; Haug, Carolin] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, GeoBio Ctr, Richard Wagner Str 10, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Hoernig, Marie K.; Kiesmueller, Christine] Univ Greifswald, Zool Inst & Museum, Cytol & Evolutionary Biol, Soldmannstr 23, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany","Haug, C (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Fac Biol, Grosshaderner Str 2, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany.; Haug, C (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, GeoBio Ctr, Richard Wagner Str 10, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",carolin.haug@palaeo-evo-devo.info,"Kiesmller, Christine/AGW-1235-2022","Kiesmller, Christine/0000-0002-4961-6565; Baranov, Viktor/0000-0003-1893-3215","Volkswagen Foundation; Lichtenberg professorship; Landesgraduiertenforderung MV; Capes/Doctoral Program (CAPES/DAAD/CNPQ) [15-2017, 88887.161379/2017-00]","We are grateful to Sven Bradler, Gottingen, and Pedro SouzaDias, Rio de Janeiro, for helpful comments on the manuscript.

Both extant representatives of the family as well as fossils are rare. Here we describe a new fossil species, Derolathrus capdoliensis n. sp., from latest Albian-earliest Cenomanian Charentese amber from the Cadeuil deposit, Charente-Maritime department in south-western France. The new species is defined by several unusual characters, most notably the co-joined but not fully fused two apical antennomeres. Derolathrus capdoliensis n. sp. is approximately contemporaneous with Kachin amber (burmite), filling an important geographical gap in the Mesozoic distribution of the family. The widespread distribution of jacobsoniid beetles in the Cretaceous, encompassing the Tethyan and Austral realms, indicates a more widespread distribution of the family during this time than in the present day and suggests that the current biogeographical range of Jacobsoniidae may be a result of extinction in northern regions. The new species shows remarkable similarity to extant members of the genus and provides further evidence of prolonged morphological, and probably also ecological, stasis in Jacobsoniidae since at least the Cretaceous.","[Tihelka, Erik; Cai, Chenyang] Univ Bristol, Sch Earth Sci, Life Sci Bldg,Tyndall Ave, Bristol BS8 1TQ, Avon, England; [Peris, David] Univ Bonn, Inst Geosci, Sect Paleontol, D-53115 Bonn, Germany; [Cai, Chenyang] Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Cai, Chenyang] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Perrichot, Vincent] Univ Rennes, CNRS, Geosci Rennes, UMR 6118, F-35000 Rennes, France","Cai, CY (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Sch Earth Sci, Life Sci Bldg,Tyndall Ave, Bristol BS8 1TQ, Avon, England.; Cai, CY (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China.; Cai, CY (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China.; Perrichot, V (corresponding author), Univ Rennes, CNRS, Geosci Rennes, UMR 6118, F-35000 Rennes, France.",cycai@nigpas.ac.cn; vincent.perrichot@univ-rennes1.fr,,,"French National Research Agency [BLAN07-1-184190]; Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [XDB26000000, XDB18000000]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [41672011, 41688103]; Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research [2019QZKK0706]; Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, Germany; Ministry of Science, Innovations and Universities, Spain (project CRE, Spanish AEI/FEDER, UE) [UE CGL2017-84419]","This study is dedicated to the late Eugene Arnaud (19222009) who generously donated a large part of his amber collection from Cadeuil to the University of Rennes, including the piece containing the specimen described herein.

All these are united by a very similar morphology, a distinct merolimnic lifecycle (aquatic larva, terrestrial pupa and adult) and by the short lifespan of the winged adults. Megaloptera is generally considered to be sister group to Neuroptera within Neuropterida. Unfortunately, the fossil record of the group is extremely scarce. Here we review the fossil record of megalopteran larvae; due to the long-lasting larval phase, one could argue that this is, in fact, the life phase with the largest ecological impact. Larvae of megalopterans are even rarer in the fossil record. Interestingly, many known larvae are preserved in amber, despite their aquatic lifestyle. Moreover, we report new specimens, including a fossil from the Miocene Foulden Maar of New Zealand, the Eocene Green River Formation, as well as different specimens preserved in amber from the Cretaceous of Myanmar. The New Zealand specimen resembles larvae of Sialidae. The Green River specimen could be a representative of Sialidae. A larger, partly incomplete amber specimen could be a representative of Corydalidae. Several small amber specimens resemble early larval stages of Chauliodinae, but also differ in important aspects. We discuss what the scarce fossil record of megalopteran larvae can tell us about their palaeo-biology and environment.","[Baranov, Viktor; Haug, Carolin; Haug, Joachim T.] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Fac Biol, Grosshaderner Str 2, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany; [Haug, Carolin; Haug, Joachim T.] LMU, GeoBioctr, Richard Wagner Str 10, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Fowler, Martin] Orchard Rd, Winchester SO21 3EX, Hants, England; [Kaulfuss, Uwe] Univ Gottingen, Dept Anim Evolut & Biodivers, Untere Karspule 2, D-37073 Gottingen, Germany; [Mueller, Patrick] Univ Hamburg, Amber Study Grp, Geol Palaeontol Museum, Bundesstr 55, D-20146 Hamburg, Germany","Baranov, V (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Fac Biol, Grosshaderner Str 2, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany.",baranow@biologie.uni-muenchen.de,,"Baranov, Viktor/0000-0003-1893-3215","Volkswagen Foundation in the frame of a Lichtenberg Professorship; German Research Foundation [DFG HA 6300/6-1, 429296833]","This project was kindly supported by the Volkswagen Foundation in the frame of a Lichtenberg Professorship (awarded to J.T.

They play also an economic role as biological pest control. Aphidlions have, mostly, elongated spindle-shaped bodies, and similarly to most lacewing larvae, they possess a pair of venom-injecting compound jaws, also called stylets. Fossils that have been interpreted as aphidlions are known from amber of different ages (about 130, 100, 35, and 15 million years old). In this study, new aphidlion-like larvae are reported from about 100 million-year-old amber from Myanmar and about 35 million-year-old Baltic amber. The shapes of head and stylets were compared between the different time slices. With the newly described fossils and specimens from the literature, a total of 361 specimens could be included in the analysis: 78 fossil larvae, 188 extant larvae of brown lacewings, and 95 extant larvae of green lacewings. The results indicate that the diversity of head shapes stays about the same over time besides a certain increase in diversity of the head shapes in brown lacewing larvae. In certain other lacewings, a distinct decrease in the diversity of head shapes was observed in the larvae. Aphidlions are larvae of certain lacewings (Neuroptera), and more precisely larvae of the groups Chrysopidae, green lacewings, and Hemerobiidae, brown lacewings. The name 'aphidlion' originates from their ecological function as specialised predators of aphids. Accordingly, they also play an economic role as biological pest control. Aphidlions have, mostly, elongated spindle-shaped bodies, and similarly to most lacewing larvae they are equipped with a pair of venom-injecting stylets. Fossils interpreted as aphidlions are known to be preserved in amber from the Cretaceous (130 and 100 million years ago), the Eocene (about 35 million years ago) and the Miocene (about 15 million years ago) ages. In this study, new aphidlion-like larvae are reported from Cretaceous amber from Myanmar (about 100 million years old) and Eocene Baltic amber. The shapes of head and stylets were compared between the different time slices. With the newly described fossils and specimens from the literature, a total of 361 specimens could be included in the analysis: 70 specimens from the Cretaceous, 5 from the Eocene, 3 from the Miocene, 188 extant larvae of Chrysopidae, and 95 extant larvae of Hemerobiidae. The results indicate that the diversity of head shapes remains largely unchanged over time, yet there is a certain increase in the diversity of head shapes in the larvae of Hemerobiidae. In certain other groups of Neuroptera, a distinct decrease in the diversity of head shapes in larval stages was observed.","[Haug, Joachim T.; Linhart, Simon; Haug, Gideon T.; Haug, Carolin] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen LMU Munich, Fac Biol, Bioctr, Grosshaderner Str 2, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany; [Haug, Joachim T.; Haug, Carolin] GeoBio Ctr LMU, Richard Wagner Str 10, D-80333 Munich, Germany","Haug, JT (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen LMU Munich, Fac Biol, Bioctr, Grosshaderner Str 2, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany.; Haug, JT (corresponding author), GeoBio Ctr LMU, Richard Wagner Str 10, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",jhaug@bio.lmu.de; s.linhart@campusimu.de; gideon.haug@palaeo-evo-devo.info; jcgroehn@t-online.de; chw.hoffeins@googlemail.com; hoffeins@aol.com; pat14789@web.de; thomas.weiterschan@web.de; joergwunderlich@t-online.de; chaug@bio.lmu.de,,"Haug, Carolin/0000-0001-9208-4229; Haug, Joachim/0000-0001-8254-8472",Volkswagen Foundation (Lichtenberg Professorship); German Research Foundation [DFG HA 6300/6-1],J.T.H. is funded by the Volkswagen Foundation (Lichtenberg Professorship) and by the German Research Foundation (DFG HA 6300/6-1).,,87,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2075-4450,,INSECTS,Insects,APR,2022,13,4,,,,,,,336,10.3390/insects13040336,,,58,Entomology,Entomology,0T1VH,WOS:000786761200001,35447779,"gold, Green Published",,,07/06/2022

Paraxiphydria resinata gen. et sp. nov. exhibits typical apomorphies of the family including a generally cylindrical body, elongate neck and dome-shaped head. Nonetheless, owing to a unique combination of traits including features hitherto unknown among species of the family, the genus is classified within a separate subfamily, Paraxiphydriinae subfam. nov. A key is presented to the suprageneric groups of Xiphydriidae. The newly described species is the first fossil xiphydriid wood wasp, extends the occurrence of Xiphydriidae into the mid-Cretaceous and adds to the known diversity of features in the family. Lastly, the simplification of wing venation and hypotheses of host-plant affiliations of early xiphydriids are discussed. We evaluate pollen associated with the wasp, assign it to the genus Cycadopites and conclude that an affiliation to the Cycadales is most likely.

Fossil findings are rarely included into the consideration, although they have a great potential to add also behavioural aspects to evolutionary reconstructions and can provide information about the minimum age of specific lifestyles in deep time. We briefly summarise concepts of reconstructing behaviour based on fossils and give a short overview of the concept of eusociality. The focus of this paper is the description of new findings of fossilised cases of aggregations in Cretaceous Myanmar amber. All specimens enclosed in these amber pieces are immatures. These findings come from four different lineages of Insecta: Neuroptera, Dermaptera, Orthoptera and Collembola. Some of these groups are usually not considered as typical examples for social interactions, but several grades of aggregation behaviour can be observed in all of these groups in different species living today. Active aggregation behaviour (or gregarious behaviour) can be seen as part and prerequisite of further social behaviour. Therefore, the investigation of this aspect can add new insights for a more comprehensive understanding of the evolution of complex strategies of social behaviour.","[Hoernig, Marie K.] Univ Greifswald, Zool Inst & Museum, Cytol & Evolutionary Biol, Soldmannstr 23, D-17489 Greifswald, Germany; [Haug, Carolin; Haug, Joachim T.] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen LMU Munich, Bioctr, Grosshaderner Str, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany; [Haug, Carolin; Haug, Joachim T.] LMU, GeoBioctr, Richard Wagner Str 10, D-80333 Munich, Germany; [Mueller, Patrick] Kreuzbergstr 90, D-66482 Zweibrucken, Germany","Haug, JT (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen LMU Munich, Bioctr, Grosshaderner Str, D-82152 Planegg Martinsried, Germany.; Haug, JT (corresponding author), LMU, GeoBioctr, Richard Wagner Str 10, D-80333 Munich, Germany.",joachim.haug@palaeo-evo-devo.info,,,Volkswagen Foundation; Lichtenberg Professorship,"We thank Bo Wang and one anonymous reviewer for helpful comments on the manuscript.

We show that Prototrichalus has tarsal formula 5-5-4, short trochanters, kidney-shaped eyes; the antennae are inserted in front of eyes and palpomeres substantially differ from all net-winged beetles. These characters identify tenebrionoid families as potential relatives of Prototrichalus. For example, extant and Eocene Ischalia Pascoe, 1860 (Anthicidae: Ischaliinae) resemble Prototrichalus in the structure of elytral costae and costal interspaces. As a result, we transfer Prototrichalus from Elateroidea: Lycidae to Tenebrionoidea incertae sedis. The earlier claim that Prototrichalus pushes the origin of Metriorrhynchini beyond earlier estimates is incorrect. The radiation of major net-winged beetle lineages was estimated-123 million years ago and the deepest splits within Metriorrhynchini to 77-98 million years ago and these estimations were not considered in the discussion on Prototrichalus. We assume that the superficial similarity in the general appearance of Prototrichalus and net-winged beetles can be a result of mimicry in already very diverse Cretaceous beetles, but only further discoveries of additional species can provide robust evidence for the convergent evolution.(c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we describe MastigocoleidaeTihelka, Jach, Kundrata & Cai fam. nov., a new family of Mesozoic dryopoids represented by fossils from the Cretaceous Yixian Formation in northeastern China (undescribed species; similar to 125 Ma), Crato Formation in northeastern Brazil (Mastigocoleus rhinocerosTihelka & Cai gen. et sp. nov.; similar to 113 Ma), and amber from northern Myanmar (Mastigocoleus resinicolaTihelka & Cai gen. et sp. nov. and Cretaceocoleus saetosus Tihelka, Kundrata & Cai gen. et sp. nov.; similar to 99 Ma). Integrating the findings of recent molecular and morphological phylogenetic analyses, we recover Mastigocoleidae as an early-diverging dryopoid Glade sister to the families Lutrochidae and Dryopidae, or less likely as a group of putative stem-dryopoids. Mastigocoleidae are most distinctly separated from all other dryopoid families by their whip-like antennae, with 11 antennomeres, reaching to the pronotal base, and with the scape broadest and longest, a short pedicel, and antennomeres II-XI more or less distinctively gradually tapering toward the apex. Mastigocoleidae indicate that the last common ancestor of Dryopoidea was likely terrestrial in the adult stage, and document character acquisitions associated with a specialization for aquatic life.

Here, we report the syninclusion of a pupa and adult of a stem ant species from Mid-Cretaceous amber. As brood are immobile, the pupa was likely to have been transported by an adult. Therefore, the fossil substantiates the hypothesis that wingless females were cooperators, thus these were true 'workers'. Re-examination of all described Cretaceous ant species reveals that winged-wingless diphenism - hence a variable dispersal capacity - may have been ancestral to the total clade of the ants, and that highly specialized worker-specific phenotypes evolved in parallel between the stem and crown groups. The soft-tissue preservation of the fossil is exceptional, demonstrating the possibility of analysing the development of the internal anatomy in stem ants. Based on the highest-resolution mu-CT scans of stem ants to date, we describe dagger Gerontoformica sternorhabda sp. nov., redescribe dagger G. gracilis, redefine the species group classification of dagger Gerontoformica, and provide a key to the species of the genus. Our work clarifies the species boundaries of dagger Gerontoformica and renders fossils relevant to the discussion of eusocial evolution in a way that has heretofore been intractable.","[Boudinot, Brendon E.; Richter, Adrian; Beutel, Rolf Georg] Friedrich Schiller Univ Jena, Inst Zool & Evolut Forsch, Erberstr 1, D-07743 Jena, Germany; [Katzke, Julian; Keller, Roberto A.; Economo, Evan P.] Okinawa Inst Sci & Technol Grad Univ, Biodivers & Biocomplex Unit, Onna, Japan; [Chaul, Julio C.

NOV.; MYCETOPHILIDAE; DIADOCIDIIDAE; POSITION; FAMILY; BOLITOPHILIDAE; BIBIONOMORPHA; CECIDOMYIIDAE,"Simple Summary Two-winged flies (Diptera) are one of the megadiverse insect orders, in terms of biodiversity. The suborder Nematocera (=lower Diptera) includes several particularly species-rich groups, such as fungus gnats (Mycetophilidae and related families of the superfamily Sciaroidea) and gall midges (Cecidomyiidae), the latter presumably even being the most diverse family of Diptera of all. Although every year dozens of new species from these families are being described, either from extant fauna or from the fossil record, an amazing number of species still remain undescribed, especially outside Europe or North America. In this paper, another portion of new taxa of fungus gnats is described, enabling to better understand the fascinating and still little-known world of insects on Earth. The following 17 extant new species of Sciaroidea (Diptera: Bibionomorpha) are described: Bolitophila nikolae Sevcik sp. nov. (Bolitophilidae, Taiwan), Catocha jingfui sp. nov. (Cecidomyiidae, Taiwan), Catocha manmiaoe sp. nov. (Cecidomyiidae, Taiwan), Catocha shengfengi sp. nov. (Cecidomyiidae, Taiwan), Planetella taiwanensis sp. nov. (Cecidomyiidae, Taiwan), Diadocidia pseudospinusola sp. nov. (Diadocidiidae, Taiwan), Asioditomyia bruneicola sp. nov. (Ditomyiidae, Brunei), Asioditomyia lacii sp. nov. (Ditomyiidae, Taiwan), Ditomyia asiatica sp. nov. (Ditomyiidae, Thailand), Chetoneura davidi sp. nov. (Keroplatidae, Brunei), Euceroplatus mantici sp. nov. (Keroplatidae, Thailand), Setostylus fangshuoi sp. nov. (Keroplatidae, Taiwan), Platyceridion yunfui sp. nov. (Keroplatidae, Hainan), Terocelion adami sp. nov. (Keroplatidae, Taiwan), Hadroneura martini sp. nov. (Mycetophilidae, Taiwan), Paratinia furcata sp. nov. (Mycetophilidae, Czech Republic, Slovakia), and Nepaletricha sikorai sp. nov. (Sciaroidea incertae sedis, Thailand). Two new genera are described from the mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber, Burmasymmerus gen. nov. (Ditomyiidae, type species Burmasymmerus korneliae sp. nov., including also B. wieslawi sp. nov.), representing the first record of the family Ditomyiidae from the Mesozoic, and Burmatricha gen. nov. (Sciaroidea incertae sedis, type species Burmatricha mesozoica sp. nov.). Molecular phylogeny of Ditomyiidae, based on two DNA markers (28S, COI), as well as that of Catocha Haliday, 1833, based on the mitochondrial COI and 16S fragments, are also presented.","[Sevcik, Jan; Burdikova, Nikola] Univ Ostrava, Fac Sci, Chittussiho 10, CZ-71000 Ostrava, Czech Republic; [Sevcik, Jan] Silesian Museum, Nadrazni Okruh 31, CZ-74601 Opava, Czech Republic; [Hippa, Heikki] Univ Turku, Biodivers Unit, Zool Museum, FI-20014 Turku, Finland","Sevcik, J (corresponding author), Univ Ostrava, Fac Sci, Chittussiho 10, CZ-71000 Ostrava, Czech Republic.; Sevcik, J (corresponding author), Silesian Museum, Nadrazni Okruh 31, CZ-74601 Opava, Czech Republic.",sevcikjan@hotmail.com; heikki.hippa@gmail.com; burdikova@seznam.cz,"Sevcik, Jan/D-7307-2014","Sevcik, Jan/0000-0001-7174-593X","Ministry of Education of the Czech Republic; Ministry of Culture of the Czech Republic [MK000100595]; European Union [CZ.1.05/2.1.00/03.0100]; National Feasibility Program I, project LO1208, of Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic; U.S. National Science Foundation [DEB-0542864]; National Research Council of Thailand; Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation, Thailand","This research was funded by the Ministry of Education of the Czech Republic by institutional financing of long-term conceptual development of the research institution (University of Ostrava) and by the Ministry of Culture of the Czech Republic by institutional financing of long-term conceptual development of the research institution (the Silesian Museum, MK000100595).
