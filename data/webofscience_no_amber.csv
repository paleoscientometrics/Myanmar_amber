The material is collected from the upper part of the Irrawaddy sediments (Plio-Pleistocene) in central Myanmar. D. gwebinensis sp. nov. is morphologically more similar to the extant species D. sumatrensis (Sumatran rhinoceros) than to other species of the genus but differs from D. sumatrensis in having the comparatively shorter nasal, the more concave dorsal profile of the skull, the more elevated occiput and presence of molar crista in M3/. This is the first discovery of Dicerorhinus in the upper Miocene to lower Pleistocene of the Indian subcontinent and Mainland Southeast Asia, and fills the chronological and geographical gap of this lineage in Asia. The Dicerorhinus clade probably migrated into Southeast Asia from East Asia by the Pliocene or early Pleistocene. This hypothesis is supported by the scarcity or absence of this clade in the Neogene mammalian fauna of the Indian Subcontinent.","[Zin-Maung-Maung-Thein; Takai, Masanaru; Thaung-Htike] Kyoto Univ, Primate Res Inst, Aichi 4848506, Japan; [Tsubamoto, Takehisa] Hayashibara Biochem Labs Inc, Ctr Paleobiol Res, Okayama 7000907, Japan; [Egi, Naoko] Japan Monkey Ctr, Aichi 4840081, Japan","Zin-Maung-Maung-Thein (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Primate Res Inst, Aichi 4848506, Japan.",zinmaung@pri.kyoto-u.ac.jp; takai@pri.kyoto-u.ac.jp; sorlestes@msc.biglobe.ne.jp; htike@pri.kyoto-u.ac.jp; egi@pri.kyoto-u.ac.jp; unakaya@cybertech.net.mm,,,"MEXT Overseas Scientific Research FundMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [16405018]; MEXT Grant-in-Aid for the 21st Century COE ProgramMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)","We gratefully thank to the personnel from the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Culture of the Union of Myanmar for giving permission for the field works in Myanmar.

Recently, a black to gray carbonaceous mudstone unit containing abundant plant fossils was discovered just below the lowest part of Thitspin Limestone Formation from the Linwe Area, eastern Myanmar. Although only five taxa were identified, the plant assemblage provides the first evidence of the occurrence of Cathaysian elements in eastern Myanmar and potentially indicates the presence of a highly diverse Permian flora. Among the five species, Cordaites principalis and Annularia mucronata were cosmopolitan species; while Callipteridum cf. koraiense, Taeniopteris crassinervis Mo and Rhipidopsis lobata were mostly recorded in the Cathaysia Flora. Therefore, the present assemblage generally indicates a palaeobiogeographical affinity to the Cathaysian Province. Stratigraphically, Callipteridum cf. koraiense was mainly reported from Cisuralian to Wordian; whereas Taeniopteris crasssnervis Mo and Rhipidopsis lobata were recorded from Capitanian to Changhsingian, which suggests a general Permian age based on the plant assemblage itself only. However, the carbonaceous mudstone at the outcrop is overlain by the Thitspin Limestone Formation containing middle Guadalupian fusulinids. Based on previous faunal analyses, the Sibumasu terrane contains typical Gondwanan cold-water faunas during the early Cisuralian, warm-water faunas occurred after Sakmarian. Thus, age of the fossil-plant-containing carbonaceous mudstone is very likely between late Cisuralian and early Guadalupian as constrained by its overlying fusulinids and its warm Cathaysian palaeobiogeographical affinity.

Rhynchonelliformean, craniiformean and linguliformean brachiopods studied belong to 23 genera and a few indeterminate taxa, among which the most abundant genus Kinnella, along with the four common genera (Paromalomena, Pseudopholidops, Fardenia, and Dalmanella), and other genera (such as Clifionia, Draborthis, Hindella, Hirnantia, Leptaena, Mirorthis, Plectothyrella, Skenidioides, and Xenocrania) are recorded for the first time. This high diversity Hirnantia Fauna represents an ecological differentiation within the benthos of the Sibumasu Terrane during the end Ordovician global crisis. The palaeoeco-unit named herein as the Kinnella-Paromalomena Association is assigned to lower BA3. This paper includes a taxonomic revision with the following conclusions: 1) Sinomena Zeng et al. and Yichangomena Zeng et al. are treated as junior synonyms of Eostropheodonta Bancroft; 2) Hubeinomena Zeng et al. is regarded as a juvenile form of Coolinia Bancroft; 3) Paramirorthis Zeng et al. is considered an immature growth stage of Mirorthis Zeng; 4) Shanomena Cocks and Fortey is treated as a junior synonym of Paromalomena Rong; 5) Scenidium? medlicotti Reed is redesignated as the type species of Kinnella Bergstrom to replace Hirnantia? kielanae Temple. The distribution of the Hirnantia Fauna in Myanmar, Thailand and western Yunnan of the Sibumasu Terrane highlights the distinctive nature of the Mandalay fauna, and the analyses of the Hirnantia Fauna and others of Sibumasu shows that Sibumasu was not located far from the South China and Lhasa palaeoplates during late Middle and Late Ordovician.

The murids consist of Hapalomys cf. longicaudatus, Maxomys pliosurifer sp. nov., Rattus jaegeri and cf. Rattus sp. indet., which include both extinct and extant forms. Maxomys pliosurifer is relatively similar to Maxomys surifer that lives in South-East Asia in terms of tooth morphology but retains plesiomorphic features shared with the ancestral rat, Karnimata, and possible sister genera of Maxomys, such as Ratchaburimys and Millardia. The three hystricids belong to the genus Hystrix and consist of two extinct brachydont species (Hystrix paukensis and Hystrix sp. indet.) and one hypsodont species similar to living form (Hystrix cf. brachyura). This finding indicates that primitive brachydont species and derived hypsodont species of Hystrix had likely coexisted in the locality, but the brachydont species are significantly more common amongst specimens collected from the Gwebin area. The spalacid species is Cannomys cf. badius and the sciurid species is Menetes sp. indet. These two rodents are similar to living species in continental South-East Asia although they show minor differences in tooth characteristics compared to the living forms. Some species and genera of the fossil rodent assemblage from the Gwebin area also occur in Upper Pliocene localities of Thailand, suggesting chronological correlation between these two faunas. Moreover, these fossil rodent assemblages are composed primarily of the species distributed endemically in continental South-East Asia. Late Pliocene rodents of continental South-East Asia were affected by river barriers that formed during the Mio-Pliocene, and they were probably not able to disperse from South-East Asia into South and East Asia.

New material from South China and Myanmar allows establishment of a new genus, Xenocrania, including its type species Palaeocyclus? haimei Reed from the Hirnantia fauna in northern Shan State, Myanmar. This genus is characterized by a unique ornamentation with a large degree of intraspecific variation in sympatric and allopatric populations. Three types of ornamentation (A, B and C) are recognized within the same population of this species, and even on the same individual. Based on this high degree of variation, we consider Xenocrania haimei and Acanthocrania yichangensis Zeng from the Hirnantia fauna of Yichang, western Hubei, South China to be conspecific. X. haimei was probably an opportunistic species, exhibiting considerable significant phenotypic pleiotropy (exemplified by a highly variable ornament) in response to severe ecological stress, particularly during the end Ordovician crisis, enabling the species to survive the extinction event. Geographically, Xenocrania gen. nov. occurs not only in the Hirnantia fauna of Myanmar (Sibumasu) and South China, but also in England (Avalonia), Poland (Baltica) and probably also Bohemia (Perunica). A further reassessment of many nominal or indeterminate taxa of Ordovician and Silurian craniides tentatively attributed to Philhedra, Acanthocrania and other related genera is needed.","[Chen, Di] Nanjing Univ, Sch Earth Sci & Engn, 163 Xianlin Dadao, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Rong, Jiayu] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, 39 East Rd, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Rong, JY (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, 39 East Rd, Nanjing 210008, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",jyrong@nigpas.ac.cn,,,Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB26000000]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41521061],"We are indebted to Jiang Baoyu from Nanjing University for his kindness in making arrangements for Chen Di's investigations.

These fusulines broadly indicate a Midian (middle Permian, Guadalupian) age. The lower diversity and the presence of some genera, such as Monodiexodina and Eopolydiexodina, suggest that the Sibumasu Block belonged to the palaeobiogeographic Cimmerian Province during the Midian. Furthermore, quantitative cluster analysis of middle Permian fusulines from the Shan Plateau and adjacent Cimmerian blocks suggests close faunal affinities between the Sibumasu Block and the Baoshan Block in western Yunnan. More importantly, the widespread occurrence of fusulines Eopolydiexodina afghanensis and Jinzhangia shengi on the Shan Plateau is similar to that of contemporaneous fusuline faunas from the Baoshan Block and the South Qiangtang Block but different to that of the Tengchong and Lhasa Blocks, which are dominated by the characteristic Nankinella-Chusenella assemblage. This faunal discrepancy provides strong evidence that the Bangong-Nujiang suture passes through the Gaoligong Orogen in western Yunnan rather than through the Myitkyina ophiolites in northern Myanmar. Additionally, palaeobiogeographical analysis of these fusuline faunas from the Lhasa, Tengchong, South Qiangtang, Baoshan and Sibumasu Blocks implies that the Bangong-Nujiang Ocean might have been present before the Midian.","[Zhang, Yi-Chun; Zhang, Hua] Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yi-Chun; Zhang, Hua] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China; [Aung, Kyi Pyar] Banmaw Univ, Dept Geol, Mansi, Kachin State, Myanmar; [Shen, Shu-Zhong] Nanjing Univ, Sch Earth Sci & Engn, Nanjing 210023, Peoples R China; [Zaw, Than; Ding, Lin; Cai, Fu-Long] Inst Tibetan Plateau Res, Key Lab Continental Collis & Plateau Uplift, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Zaw, Than; Sein, Kyaing] Myanmar Geosci Soc, Yangon, Myanmar; [Ding, Lin] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Zhang, YC (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Nanjing Inst Geol & Palaeontol, State Key Lab Palaeobiol & Stratig, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China.; Zhang, YC (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, 39 East Beijing Rd, Nanjing 210008, Peoples R China.",yczhang@nigpas.ac.cn,"; chen, shu zhong/D-8214-2011","?, ??/0000-0001-9807-6887; chen, shu zhong/0000-0001-8380-0692","Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research [2019QZKK0706]; National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [91855205]; Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB26000000, XDB18030400]; Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS [2016282]","We thank Prof. Cengiz Okuyucu and Prof. Merlynd Nestell for their critical reviews that improved the manuscript.

The co-occurrence of forest-dwelling Microbunodon and grass-eating and semi-aquatic Me. dissimilis reinforces that central Myanmar was less arid and had a wider range of habitats than the northern Indian Subcontinent during the Pliocene.

The fossil record of primitive ruminants in Pondaung is now represented by five genera, and the occurrence of both of these taxa in the Paleogene of Myanmar supports the hypothesis that the initial radiation and diversification of basal ruminants probably occurred during the first part of the Eocene in southern Asia.

Here, we describe crocodylians from the Neogene Irrawaddy Formation of central Myanmar and evaluate their taxonomic status. Tebingan, SE of Magway (lower Upper Miocene) yields Gavialis and Crocodylus that differ from the previously known species of each genus, and the Gwebin area, SW of Bagan (Upper Pliocene) produces Crocodylus cf. palaeindicus. Taking into account the materials without provenance data, Neogene crocodylians from Myanmar include at least three gavialids and two Crocodylus that are characterized by different craniomandibular and postcranial features. The body length estimates for the gavialines from Tebingan and an unknown locality in central Myanmar are 7.5 m and 8.6 m, respectively, which exceed the maximum size limit of extant Gavialis gangeticus. Together with the previously reported large taxa, gavialids repeatedly evolved large body sizes in the Neogene of Asia. Gavialis from the Miocene of Myanmar is one of the oldest records of the genus, and its unraised orbital rim suggests that the telescoped eyes derived later during the genus evolution. Crocodylus cf. palaeindicus from the Pliocene of Myanmar indicates the species range was extended from western India to Myanmar during the Neogene. The absence of Crocodylus siamensis in the Neogene of India and central Myanmar implies the species originated east of central Myanmar.","[Iijima, Masaya] Hefei Univ Technol, Engn Res Ctr Mineral Resources & Mine Environm, Sch Resource & Environm Engn, 193 Tunxi Rd, Hefei 230009, Anhui, Peoples R China; [Iijima, Masaya] Clemson Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Clemson, SC 29634 USA; [Iijima, Masaya] Nagoya Univ Museum, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan; [Takai, Masanaru] Kyoto Univ, Primate Res Inst, Inuyama, Aichi 4848506, Japan; [Nishioka, Yuichiro] Museum Nat & Environm Hist, 5762 Oya, Suruga, Shizuoka 4228017, Japan; [Thaung-Htike] Univ Yangon, Univ Ave, Yangon 11041, Myanmar; [Zin-Maung-Maung-Thein] Univ Mandalay, Dept Geol, Mahaaungmyae 05032, Mandalay, Myanmar; [Egi, Naoko] Natl Museum Nat & Sci, Dept Anthropol, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 3050005, Japan; [Kusuhashi, Nao; Tsubamoto, Takehisa] Ehime Univ, Grad Sch Sci & Engn, Matsuyama, Ehime 7908577, Japan; [Kono, Reiko T.] Keio Univ, Fac Letters, Kohoku Ku, 4-1-1 Hiyoshi, Yokohama, Kanagawa 2238521, Japan; [Hirayama, Ren] Waseda Univ, Sch Int Liberal Studies, Shinjuku Ku, 1-6-1 Nishi Waseda, Tokyo 1698050, Japan","Iijima, M (corresponding author), Hefei Univ Technol, Engn Res Ctr Mineral Resources & Mine Environm, Sch Resource & Environm Engn, 193 Tunxi Rd, Hefei 230009, Anhui, Peoples R China.; Iijima, M (corresponding author), Clemson Univ, Dept Biol Sci, Clemson, SC 29634 USA.; Iijima, M (corresponding author), Nagoya Univ Museum, Chikusa Ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan.",miijima8@gmail.com; takai.masanaru.2s@kyoto-u.ac.jp,,"Hirayama, Ren/0000-0002-0823-5272","National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41772003, 41402015, 42002021]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of ChinaFundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [PA2020GDKC0022]; China Postdoctoral Science FoundationChina Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2018M642511]; JSPSMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of Science [26304019, 19J00701]","Tai Kubo and Mugino O.

The first Eocene mammals from Asia were collected in Myanmar and described in 1916, while the first primates, Pondaungia and Amphipithecus, were described in 1927 and 1937, respectively, both from the Pondaung Formation in Myanmar. For the next 60 years, these two Pondaung taxa remained as the only known Eocene primates from Myanmar and one of the few records of Eocene primates from all of Asia. Taxonomically, Pondaungia and Amphipithecus were linked with a number of different groups, including archaic, hoofed ungulates (condylarths), adapiform primates, omomyid primates, and anthropoids. While no consensus existed, Pondaungia and Amphipithecus were most commonly compared with anthropoids. Beginning in the late 1990s, new primates were discovered in Myanmar, including smaller-bodied forms such as Bahinia and Myanmarpithecus. Also, new and better specimens of the larger-bodied Pondaungia and Amphipithecus began to appear, including the first cranial and postcranial fragments. Evaluations based on these new specimens, especially the postcrania, indicate that the two larger-bodied Myanmar taxa are adapiform primates that show their closest affinities to North American notharctines. The smaller-bodied taxa remain enigmatic, but may share their closest affinities with North American and Asian omomyid primates and Asian Tarsius. None of the known Asian primate taxa appear closely related to African anthropoids, which suggests that true anthropoids did not reach Asia until the latest Oligocene or earliest Miocene. These facts make an Asian origin for Anthropoidea unlikely. Additional and earlier evidence from both Asia and Africa is required before the ultimate origin of anthropoids can be determined. It appears possible that true anthropoids were an ancient radiation that may have been part of a Gondwanan (southern hemisphere) community that is, at present, poorly sampled and little understood.

This specimen is the first postcranial element of a rodent from the Pondaung Formation and the oldest postcranial fossil currently known for Anomaluroidea. It illuminates plesiomorphous postcranial conditions in early anomaluroids and provides a basis for reconstructing the evolution of arboreal locomotion in this group of rodents. In contrast to those of living anomaluroids, the astragalus of Pondaungimys bears features indicating a less mobile ankle, specifically including a reduced range of plantarfiexion at the upper ankle joint and a diminished capacity for inversion at the lower ankle joint. Its anatomy suggests that early anomaluroids were generalized quadrupeds, with intermediate arboreal adaptations between those of paramyids and modern anomaluroids. A cladistic analysis based on astragalar characters corroborates a basal position for Pondaungimys among anomaluroids. The phylogenetic signal derived from astragalar morphology is consistent with recent assessments of relationships among living anomaluroids based on craniodental characters and molecular data. Stem anomaluroids such as Pondaungimys apparently lacked the ability to glide, a locomotor pattern that is retained in extant Zenkerella.","[Coster, Pauline M.; Beard, K.

Fusulinids from Eastern Myanmar remain poorly known despite their biochronological and paleogeographical significance. This paper describes Rugososchwagevina (Xiaoxinzhaiella) subrotunda sp. nov. and Chusenella quasidouvillei of Murgabian age (Middle Permian) from the Thitsipin Formation at the Pindaya in the Shan Plateau, Eastern Myanmar. Taxonomic analysis of this new collection and of Rugososchwagevina (s.l.) in the literature leads us to suppress Xiaoxinzhaiella Shi, Yang & Jin, 2005 as a subgenus of Rugososchwagevina Miklukho-Maklay, 1959. This subgenus is diagnosed with much tighter coiling and reduced septal folding in juvenarium as well as relatively smaller test diameter throughout the ontogeny, compared with Rugososchwagevina (s.s.) which is typified by R. yabei Skinner & Wilde, 1966. Furthermore, our comprehensive review reveals that the known occurrences of R. (Xiaoxinzhaiella) are strictly confined within blocks that previously constituted the Cimmerian Continent during the Permian period, and they were even more widespread than Rugososchwagevina (s.s.) among these blocks. Therefore, the previous understanding that Rugososchwagevina (s.l.) is characteristic for the Middle Permian Cimmerian region can be refined. We propose that R. (Xiaoxinzhaiella) is more appropriate as the truly endemic foraminiferal index signifying Cimmerian affinity.","[Huang, Hao; Jin, Xiaochi] Chinese Acad Geol Sci, Inst Geol, 26 Baiwanzhuang Rd, Beijing 100037, Peoples R China; [Shi, Yukun] Nanjing Univ, Ctr Res & Educ Biol Evolut & Environm, 163 Xianlin Rd, Nanjing 210023, Jiangsu, Peoples R China","Huang, H (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Geol Sci, Inst Geol, 26 Baiwanzhuang Rd, Beijing 100037, Peoples R China.",geohaohuang@gmail.com,,,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41630104, 41872036]; China Geological SurveyChina Geological Survey [DD20190008]","We deeply appreciate Katsumi Ueno, Daniel Vachard and another anonymous reviewer for their constructive criticism of this manuscript.

In this paper, we describe new material, notably a skull, of the anomaluroid taxon Pondaumgimys anomaluropsis Dawson et al., 2003, recently described from the latest middle Eocene Pondaung Formation in Central Myanmar (South Asia). Pondaungimys shows a dental pattern very similar to that of Nementchamys, an anomaluroid rodent previously reported from roughly coeval deposits in Algeria. Although Nementchamys and Pondaungimys have a dental pattern relatively more primitive in some respects than that of Miocene and modern anomalurids, in other respects they show a derived dental complexity that leads us to consider both taxa as the closest outgroups of the Anomaluridae sensu stricto (the true scaly-tailed flying squirrels) within the Anomaluroidea. Pondaungimys clearly demonstrates that the evolutionary history of the anomaluroid rodents is not limited to Africa. The widespread South Asian-North African distribution of the late middle Eocene forms strongly suggests that faunal exchanges between Africa and Asia took place during the Paleogene, a statement supported by other mammalian groups.","[Marivaux;Ducrocq;Jaeger;Marandat;Sudre;Soe]Univ Montpellier 2, Lab Paleontol, Inst Sci Evolut, CNRS,UMR 5554, F-34095 Montpellier, France; [Chaimanee]Dept Mineral Resources, Paleontol Sect, Geol Survey Div, Bangkok 10400, Thailand; [Tun;Htoon;Soe]Univ Yangon, Dept Geol, Yangon 11041, Myanmar","Marivaux, L (corresponding author), Univ Montpellier 2, Lab Paleontol, Inst Sci Evolut, CNRS,UMR 5554, CC 064,Pl Eugene Bataillon, F-34095 Montpellier, France.",marivaux@isem.univ-montp2.fr; ducrocq@isem.univ-montp2.fr; jaeger@isem.univ-montp2.fr; marandat@isem.univ-montp2.fr; yaocmn@yahoo.com; aung@isem.univ-montp2.fr,,,,,,76,31,33,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",0272-4634,1937-2809,,J VERTEBR PALEONTOL,J.

According to its dentition and skull structure, Siamotherium pondaungensis was most likely a terrestrial, open-forest animal with an omnivorous diet that showed no significant adaptation to folivory.

Among the three proviverrines known from the fauna, Kyawdawia lupina gen. et sp. nov. is represented by the most complete dental materials. Kyowdawia is similar to the proviverrines known from the Eocene and middle Miocene of India-Pakistan and from the late Eocene to middle Miocene of Africa, in that it has a short protocone and strong buccal cingulum on M1-2, a small metaconid on m2-3 and a well-basined talonid on p4-m2. In addition, it lacks an anterior accessory cusp on p4 and the distinction between the hypoconulid and entoconic! on the lower molars. it is unique among the Afroasian proviverrines in lacking a protocone lobe on P4 and in having a broader paracone relative to the metacone on M1-2. This species is one of the largest proviverrines and was estimated to be the size of a red wolf. The type specimen includes postcranial materials. The well-developed deltopectoral crest, supracondylar ridge and medial epicondyle of the humerus and the relatively short gracile tibia suggest some digging adaptations, white the two well preserved caudal vertebrae indicate the presence of a long tail. The cladistic analysis Of 14 proviverrines from Europe and Afroasia based on dental morphologies supports the monophyly of proviverrines from Africa and South and Southeast Asia. This group must have originated from the European forms by the early Eocene and dispersed into South and Southeast Asia. Kyawdawia is phylogenetically closest to Masrasector from the [ate Eocene to early Oligocene of Egypt and Oman, and the second closest to Paratritemnodon from the middle Eocene of India-Pakistan. The other two Pondaung proviverrines, Yarshea cruenta and an indeterminate proviverrine, are also close to these genera.","[Egi]Kyoto Univ, Dept Zool, Kyoto 6068502, Japan; [Holroyd]Univ Calif Berkeley, Museum Paleontol, Berkeley, CA 94720 USA; [Tsubamoto]Kyoto Univ, Primate Res Inst, Aichi 4848506, Japan; [Soe]Univ Yangon, Dept Geol, Yangon, Myanmar; [Takai]Univ Iowa, Dept Anthropol, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA; [Ciochon]Univ Iowa, Dept Pediat Dent, Iowa City, IA 52242 USA","Egi, N (corresponding author), Kyoto Univ, Dept Zool, Kyoto 6068502, Japan.",,,"Holroyd, Patricia/0000-0003-1292-6356","Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [14405019] Funding Source: KAKEN",,,112,20,22,0,4,TAYLOR & FRANCIS LTD,ABINGDON,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",1477-2019,1478-0941,,J SYST PALAEONTOL,J.

Shazurus is surprisingly specialized for its age, being most similar in dental morphology to early Miocene Paranomalurus and extant Anomalurus, and is quite different from the roughly contemporaneous anomaluroid genera Nementchamys and Pondaungimys from Algeria and Myanmar, respectively. Parsimony analysis of dental features places Shazurus within crown Anomaluridae as a sister group of two species of Paranomalurus to the exclusion of extant Anomalurus and Idiurus. The marked morphological differences between the two oldest Afro-Arabian anomaluroids (Shazurus and Nementchamys) suggest that the taxa share a much more ancient common Afro-Arabian ancestor, possibly derived from Zegdoumyidae. Isolated teeth of Shazurus and other Eocene anomaluroids reveal little about their palaeobiology, but the complete absence of Anomaluroidea from the younger ( late Eocene to early Oligocene) Jebel Qatrani Formation is presumably a reflection of environmental change through the late Eocene in northern Africa.","[Sallam, Hesham M.] Univ Oxford, Dept Earth Sci, Oxford OX1 3PR, England; [Seiffert, Erik R.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Anat Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Simons, Elwyn L.] Duke Lemur Ctr, Div Fossil Primates, Durham, NC 27705 USA","Sallam, HM (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Dept Earth Sci, Parks Rd, Oxford OX1 3PR, England.",sallam@mans.edu.eg; erik.seiffert@stonybrook.edu; esimons@duke.edu,,"Sallam, Hesham/0000-0001-6584-6312","U.S. National Science FoundationNational Science Foundation (NSF) [BCS-0416164, BCS-0819186]; The Leakey Foundation; Egyptian Government","This research was funded by U.S. National Science Foundation grant BCS-0416164 to E.L.S. and E.R.S. and BCS-0819186 to E.

Many types of rock-boring organisms break down hard substrates, particularly carbonate rocks and calcareous structures such as dead corals and shells. In paleontology, the presence of rocks with boreholes and fossil macroboring assemblage members is one of the primary diagnostic features of shallow marine paleo-environments. Here we describe a silicate rock-boring organism and an associated community in submerged siltstone rock outcrops in Kaladan River, Myanmar. The rock-boring mussel Lignopholas fluminalis is a close relative of the marine piddocks, and its borings belong to the ichnospecies Gastrochaenolites anauchen. The neotectonic uplift of the area leading to gradual decrease of the sea level with subsequent shift from estuarine to freshwater environment was the most likely driver for the origin of this community. Our findings highlight that rocks with macroborings are not an exclusive indicator of marine paleo-ecosystems, but may also reflect freshwater habitats.","[Bolotov, Ivan N.; Aksenova, Olga V.; Gofarov, Mikhail Yu.; Kondakov, Alexander V.; Konopleva, Ekaterina S.; Lyubas, Artyom A.; Vikhrev, Ilya V.] Northern Arctic Fed Univ, Arkhangelsk 163002, Russia; [Bolotov, Ivan N.; Aksenova, Olga V.; Gofarov, Mikhail Yu.; Kondakov, Alexander V.; Konopleva, Ekaterina S.; Lyubas, Artyom A.; Vikhrev, Ilya V.] Russian Acad Sci, Fed Ctr Integrated Arctic Res, Arkhangelsk 163000, Russia; [Bakken, Torkild] Norwegian Univ Sci & Technol, NTNU Univ Museum, N-7491 Trondheim, Norway; [Glasby, Christopher J.] Museum & Art Gallery Northern Terr, Darwin, NT 0820, Australia; [Lopes-Lima, Manuel] Univ Porto, CIIMAR Interdisciplinary Ctr Marine & Environm Re, P-4450208 Matosinhos, Portugal; [Lopes-Lima, Manuel] Univ Porto, CIBIO, InBIO Res Ctr Biodivers & Genet Resources, P-4485661 Vairao, Portugal; [Wang, Yu] Nanyang Technol Univ, Earth Observ Singapore, Singapore 639798, Singapore; [Wang, Yu; Shyu, J.

Altogether 22 genera and two undetermined taxa were identified; dominant are Aegiromena, Anisopleurella, Fardenia, Dalmanella, Hirnantia and Hindella, less common, Paromalomena, Leptaena, Eostropheodonta, Cliftonia, Kinnella, Templeella and Plectothyrella, together with some rare Petrocrania, Xenocrania, Pseudopholidops, Pal aeoleptostrophia, Skenidioides, Giraldibella, Draborthis, Dolerorthis and Toxorthis. This is one of the most diverse typical Hirnantia faunas, associated with the Kosov Province. The paleobiogeographic relationships between western Yunnan (Southwest China), Myanmar, Yichang (Central China), Tibet (Southwest China) and Kazakhstan are clarified using Network Analysis and NMDS. The fauna studied is most similar to that of Myanmar; both resided on the Sibumasu terrane. However, the recalculated network diagram, when including the data of Hirnantia fauna from the Prague Basin, indicates that the latter is more closely linked to that of western Yunnan, a testament to the very weak brachiopod provincialism during the Hirnantian, mainly due to the influence of dominant cosmopolitan taxa. Some species of the fauna display significant population variation. Two of the dominant taxa, Aegiromena and Anisopleurella are systematically described, whereas the other two common taxa, Fardenia and Hirnantia are measured and their outlines and internal structures analyzed.

Based on current knowledge of the associated fauna, this new species of Apidium is early Oligocene in age, being roughly contemporaneous with faunas from Quarries G and V in the upper part of the Jebel Qatrani Formation in Egypt that also contain species of Apidium. A phylogenetic analysis based on dental characters indicates that the new species of Apidium from Libya is the sister group of Apidium phiomense. Apidium bowni and Apidium moustafai from the Jebel Qatrani Formation in the Fayum are similar in age to the new species of Apidium from Libya, but both of these Egyptian species are more distantly related to A. phiomense from younger stratigraphic levels in the Fayum. This phylogenetic pattern underscores the benefit of enhanced geographic sampling of the fossil record, even in cases where local records are thought to be reasonably comprehensive and well documented. Oligocene parapithecids can be partitioned into two clades corresponding to the subfamilies Parapithecinae (containing Parapithecus and Simonsius) and Qatraniinae (including Qatrania and Apidium). Climatic deterioration during the early Oligocene may have impacted the macroevolutionary dynamics of early Afro-Arabian anthropoids by fostering the fragmentation of forest habitats, thereby promoting allopatric speciation among widespread populations of Apidium and other arboreal taxa.

Location Indochina and Sundaland, including Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, the Malay Peninsula, Borneo, Sumatra and Java. Methods This study reconstructs the habitat types of 25 Pleistocene sites in Southeast Asia through a synecological (community-based) method. This method specifically targets medium- and large-bodied mammals, and ecovariables that could be directly assessed from species lists were chosen. The methods allow the reconstruction of fossil sites as closed (continuous tree cover), mixed (heterogeneous tree cover) and open (very limited to no tree cover) through discriminant functions analysis of community guild structure. Results Four Pleistocene sites can confidently be assigned to one of the three habitat types. Tam Hang (south), a Middle Pleistocene site from Laos, is classified as mixed. Ban Fa Suai, a Middle Pleistocene site from Thailand, is also classified as mixed. Trinil, a Middle Pleistocene site from Java, is classified as open. Lastly, Hang Hum II, a Late Pleistocene site from Vietnam, is classified as open. Insufficient species are present in the fossil faunas of remaining sites to allow statistically confident habitat assignment. Nevertheless, conditional habitat assignments can be achieved, and these are largely congruent with other palaeoenvironmental evidence. Main conclusions Medium- and large-bodied mammals are the most frequently recovered mammals from Pleistocene sites in Southeast Asia. Previous palaeoenvironmental reconstructions of these sites have been hampered by this body size bias, as well as by limited site and faunal descriptions. However, our analysis demonstrates that reconstructions can still be achieved for megafauna-bearing sites in the region. The reconstructions suggest that through much of the Pleistocene, Southeast Asia had significant areas of mixed habitats, and that the widespread distribution of rain forests, such as found today, was a relatively rare phenomenon.","[Louys, Julien] Liverpool John Moores Univ, Sch Nat Sci & Psychol, Res Ctr Evolutionary Anthropol & Palaeoecol, Liverpool L3 3AF, Merseyside, England; [Louys, Julien] Univ New S Wales, Sch Biol Earth & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Meijaard, Erik] People & Nat Consulting Int, Badung 80361, Bali, Indonesia; [Meijaard, Erik] Australian Natl Univ, Sch Archaeol & Anthropol, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia","Louys, J (corresponding author), Liverpool John Moores Univ, Sch Nat Sci & Psychol, Res Ctr Evolutionary Anthropol & Palaeoecol, James Parsons Bldg, Liverpool L3 3AF, Merseyside, England.",j.louys@ljmu.ac.uk,"; Meijaard, Erik/A-2687-2016","Louys, Julien/0000-0001-7539-0689; Meijaard, Erik/0000-0001-8685-3685",Leverhulme TrustLeverhulme Trust [FC00754C],L. acknowledges the support of the Leverhulme Trust (FC00754C).

This paper provides a full description of the species and a comment on the early evolution of Hyaenaelurinae. Some features of Orienspiterodon (p2-p3 without an anterior accessory cuspulid, lesser reduction of the m3 talonid relative to m1-m2 talonids' double-rooted P3, and better fusion of the paracone and metacone on M1) confirm that O. dahkoensis is distinct from Pterodon. Orienspterodon differs from the other specialized hyaenodontids from the Paleogene of Asia in being a hyaenaelurine, in being unrelated to Hyaenodon, and in having a geographical distribution in the southern part of the continent. Orienspterodon represents the earliest fossil records of Hyaenaelurinae, and some features (small metaconid on m3, basined talonid on all lower molars, a short and more diagonally oriented metastyle, larg size, better fused paracone and metacone) indicate an early branching of this genus from the other hyaenaelurines.","[Egi]Japan Monkey Ctr, Inuyama, Aichi 4840081, Japan; [Tsubamoto;Takai]Kyoto Univ, Primate Res Inst, Inuyama, Aichi 4848506, Japan","Egi, N (corresponding author), Japan Monkey Ctr, Inuyama, Aichi 4840081, Japan.",egi@pri.kyoto-u.ac.jp,,,,,,56,11,12,1,3,PALEONTOLOGICAL SOC INC,LAWRENCE,"810 EAST 10TH ST, LAWRENCE, KS 66044 USA",0022-3360,,,J PALEONTOL,J.

The evolution of reptile herbivory and its relationship to mammalian diversification is poorly understood with respect to climate and the roles of predation pressure and competition for food resources. Here, we describe a giant fossil acrodontan lizard recovered with a diverse mammal assemblage from the late middle Eocene Pondaung Formation of Myanmar, which provides a historical test of factors controlling body size in herbivorous squamates. We infer a predominately herbivorous feeding ecology for the new acrodontan based on dental anatomy, phylogenetic relationships and body size. Ranking body masses for Pondaung Formation vertebrates indicates that the lizard occupied a size niche among the larger herbivores and was larger than most carnivorous mammals. Paleotemperature estimates of Pondaung Formation environments based on the body size of the new lizard are approximately 2-5 degrees C higher than modern. These results indicate that competitive exclusion and predation by mammals did not restrict body size evolution in these herbivorous squamates, and elevated temperatures relative to modern climates during the Paleogene greenhouse may have resulted in the evolution of gigantism through elevated poikilothermic metabolic rates and in response to increases in floral productivity.","[Head, Jason J.] Univ Nebraska, Dept Earth & Atmospher Sci, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA; [Head, Jason J.] Univ Nebraska, Nebraska State Museum Nat Hist, Lincoln, NE 68588 USA; [Gunnell, Gregg F.] Duke Lemur Ctr, Div Fossil Primates, Durham, NC 27705 USA; [Holroyd, Patricia A.; Hutchison, J.

It comes from the Huadian Formation, locality Gonglangtou, Jilin Province, north-east China. The new species represents the northernmost and one of the latest and most complete Asian Prototomus-like hyaenodontidans known. It also represents one of the youngest specimens of Sinopa, because the age of the Huadian Formation is correlated to the later Uintan and only one doubtful citation of North American Sinopa younger than the early Uintan exists. S.jilinia sp. nov. is characterized by having m3 clearly smaller than m1, very strong and extended labial molar cingulids, backward leaning protoconids in all molars and its m3 cristid obliquum joining the postvallid very labially. With S.jilina, Sinopa is the first hyaenodontidan genus known to be present on two continents during the time interval between the earliest Eocene (c.55.0Ma) and latest middle Eocene (40Ma). Its occurrence in the Huadian Formation supports the idea of a faunal exchange between North America and Asia in the early middle Eocene, a hypothesis formerly based mainly on the presence of the omomyid primate Asiomomys in the Huadian Formation, on a small radiation of East Asian trogosine tillodonts and on a couple of perissodactyl genera shared between the middle Eocene of North America and the Irdinmanhan of East Asia. As with the new Sinopa species, these Asian taxa had their closest relatives in North America.","[Morlo, Michael; Schaal, Stephan F.

In addition to providing new information about the anatomy of Eosimias centennieus, the Heti Formation sample documents substantial taxonomic diversity in the Asian eosimiid radiation. One new genus and three new species of Eosimiidae are proposed here. These include Eosimias dawsonae, n. sp.; Phenacopithecus xueshii, n. gen. and sp.; and Phenacopithecus krishtalkai, n. sp. The anatomy of the upper dentition of eosimiids is described in detail for the first time. As is the case for the lower dentition, a unique combination of primitive and derived traits characterizes the upper dentition of Eosimias and Phenacopithecus. Eosimiid upper molars bear many of the same derived features-including strong protocone cristae and the absence of a postprotocingulum-that have been cited as evidence for a special relationship between anthropoids and certain adapiforms. However, the upper molars of eosimiids further approximate those of other basal anthropoids in having reduced or absent conules and complete lingual cingula. These features are lacking in Periconodon and other adapiforms that have been regarded by some workers as being phylogenetically close to anthropoids. Given that similarities in upper molar anatomy are among the only derived features that can be cited in support of a possible adapiform ancestry for antbropoids, the occurrence of these same features in eosimiids significantly weakens the adapiform hypothesis of anthropoid origins. The holotype maxillary fragment of Phenacopithecus krishtalkai reveals that eosimiids possessed a relatively small infraorbital foramen and a deep lower face between the inferior orbital margin and the alveolar border. Eosimiids therefore lacked the orbital hypertrophy characteristic of living tarsiers and many fossil omomyids and microchoerids. Eosimiids apparently had relatively small orbits, suggesting that they maintained a diurnal activity cycle. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

This new taxon is morphologically close to the Middle Eocene genus Matthodon, with which it shares tendencies towards a robust dentition; the two genera also share the reduction of P-1. In order to examine the phylogenetic relationships of the new genus Morlodon with Early and Middle Eocene European Proviverrinae, a phylogenetic analysis of the earliest hyaenodontidans was conducted. The taxa analysed range from Late Palaeocene to Middle Eocene and are from Africa, Asia, Europe and North America. The new phylogeny of earliest hyaenodontans clarifies the systematics of the paraphyletic assemblage Proviverrinae' and results in the recognition of five major clades. The monophyly of the Limnocyoninae and Koholiinae is supported, and two new subfamilies are erected from the Proviverrinae': Sinopaninae and Arfianinae. A new definition of the Proviverrinae is proposed: only European hyaenodontidans from Early and Middle Eocene are included in this subfamily. However, the phylogenetic relationships between the five subfamilies remain to be established. An ancestral morphotype for the Hyaenodontida is proposed in order to identify the different subfamilies. On the basis of the analysis and of data presently available, an African origin for Hyaenodontida is proposed. Hyaenodontidans are involved in the faunal dispersals that occurred around the PalaeoceneEocene (P/E) boundary. They dispersed from Africa to Asia during the Late Palaeocene (Limnocyoninae), and at the P/E boundary from Africa to Europe (Proviverrinae) and to North America through Europe (Sinopaninae and Arfianinae). Proviverrinae remain an endemic European group, whereas Sinopaninae, Limnocyoninae and Arfianinae mainly evolved in North America. Koholiinae represents the sole endemic African group. The probable African origin of the Hyaenodontida supports the diphyletism of Creodonta' and abandonment of this taxon.","[Sole, Floreal] Museum Natl Hist Nat, CNRS, Dept Hist Terre, CP 38,UMR 7207,Ctr Rech Paleobiodiversite & Paleo, F-75005 Paris, France; [Sole, Floreal] Univ Lyon, CNRS, Ecole Normale Super Lyon, Inst Genom Fonct Lyon,UMR 5242,INRA,UCBL 1, F-69364 Lyon 07, France","Sole, F (corresponding author), Museum Natl Hist Nat, CNRS, Dept Hist Terre, CP 38,UMR 7207,Ctr Rech Paleobiodiversite & Paleo, 57 Rue Cuvier, F-75005 Paris, France.",sole@mnhn.fr,,,La Societe des Amis du Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle,"This study was supported by a grant from La Societe des Amis du Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle.

The new specimens consist of a skull, as well as the first records of the epiplastron and the pelvis, all of which were found in a late Pleistocene fissure-filling deposit on Okinawajima Island, the Central Ryukyus, Japan. The present material provided four new informative morphological characters for M. oyamai: the anterior epiplastral projection, the epiplastra lacking extensive overhanging lip, the wide and fan-shaped iliac blade, and the wide ischiadic plate. The results of morphological comparisons and phylogenetic analysis indicated that M. oyamai is sister to M. emys (occurring in Bangladesh, eastern India, Myanmar, Thailand, the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, and Borneo), and that M. impressa (in southern China, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam) is the basal-most taxon within Manouria. In addition, the extremely thin carapace observed in M. oyamai, which had been cited as one of three diagnostic characters of this species as well as a feature thought indicative of insular adaptation, is also present in M. impressa within this genus. The present observation therefore indicates that this character is not always attributable to insular adaptation. The results of this study along with the current paleogeographic hypothesis of the Ryukyu Archipelago suggest that M. oyamai had differentiated from an extinct ancestral species shared with M. emys on the eastern margin of Asian continent not later than the early Pleistocene.","[Takahashi, Akio] Okayama Univ Sci, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, Kita Ku, Ridai Cho 1-1, Okayama 7000005, Japan; [Hirayama, Ren] Waseda Univ, Sch Int Liberal Studies, Shinjuku Ku, Nishiwaseda 1-6-1, Tokyo 1698050, Japan; [Otsuka, Hiroyuki] Kagoshima Univ Museum, Korimoto 1-21-30, Kagoshima 8900065, Japan","Takahashi, A (corresponding author), Okayama Univ Sci, Fac Sci, Dept Zool, Kita Ku, Ridai Cho 1-1, Okayama 7000005, Japan.",akiotkh@gmail.com; renhirayama@gmail.com,,"Hirayama, Ren/0000-0002-0823-5272","JSPS KAKENHI GrantMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [15K07202]; Grants-in-Aid for Scientific ResearchMinistry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan (MEXT)Japan Society for the Promotion of ScienceGrants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) [15K07202] Funding Source: KAKEN","We are grateful to T.

The palynofossils suggest late Eocene age for the Upper Disang Formation. This formation has dinoflagellate cysts, viz., Homonyblium, Cordosphaeridium, Fibrocysta cf. axialis, Hystrichokolpoma cf. riguadiae and Operculodinium centrocarpum which indicate a shallow marine depositional environment. The lower part of the sequence (G-1 to G-22) characterised by Homonybliumfloripes, Operculodinium centrocarpum and Fibrocysta cf. axialis suggests deposition in nearshore (inner neritic) shallow marine environment, whereas, Cordosphaeridium and Hystrichokolpoma cf. rigaudiae present in the upper part of the formation (GT-1 to GT-22) suggests deposition in the nearshore, probably, outer neritic environment. Occurrence of Homotryblium floripes shows the drier period, where reduced runoff and strong evaporation led to increase salinity in nearshore restricted environment. This study suggests derivation of the sediments from a chlorite and mica- schist or gneiss or phyllite-bearing provenance. The field data along with the mineral compositions and available palynomorphs suggest that the Upper Disang shales and sandstones were deposited in a shallow marine basin during late Eocene and tropical warm humid climate condition, probably, with short time aridity, prevailed during their deposition.","[Singh, Y.

The fossil records of this genus were previously found only from the Miocene of Yunnan, Southwest China, and the Oligocene of Guangxi, South China. Here, we describe fossil fruits and associated leaves of Burretiodendron, which were discovered in the lower Oligocene Shangcun Formation of the Maoming Basin, Guangdong, South China. Morphological comparison with extant and fossil Burretiodendron taxa indicates that fruit fossils belong to the species Burretiodendron parvifructum J. Lebreton Anberree & Z. K. Zhou. This is one of the earliest fossil records of the genus, providing additional evidence for the early biogeographic history of this genus and supporting the inference that the genus originated in South China. According to the habitat conditions of modern species, we speculate that there were limestone mountains around the Maoming Basin in the early Oligocene.","[Xu Sheng-Lan; Wu Yan; Jin Jian-Hua] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Biocontrol, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China; [Xu Sheng-Lan; Wu Yan; Jin Jian-Hua] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Life Sci, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Plant Resources, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China; [Kodrul, Tatiana M.] Russian Acad Sci, Inst Geol, Moscow 119017, Russia; [Maslova, Natalia P.] Russian Acad Sci, Borissiak Paleontol Inst, Moscow 117997, Russia","Jin, JH (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Life Sci, State Key Lab Biocontrol, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China.; Jin, JH (corresponding author), Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Life Sci, Guangdong Prov Key Lab Plant Resources, Guangzhou 510275, Peoples R China.",lssjjh@mail.sysu.edu.cn,"Kodrul, Tatiana/AAM-3005-2021; Maslova, Natalia/AAN-9728-2021",,"National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41872015, 41820104002, 41210001]; State Key Laboratory of Paleobiology and Stratigraphy (Nanjing Institute of Geology and Paleontology, CAS)Chinese Academy of Sciences [193118]; Scientific Research Fund, Hongda Zhang, Sun Yat-sen University; Geological Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences [075-00872-20-00]; Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR)Russian Foundation for Basic Research (RFBR) [19-04-00046]","We are grateful to the staff at Sun Yat-sen University Herbarium (SYS) and the Herbarium of the South China Botanical Garden (IBSC), Chinese Academy of Sciences for allowing us to examine and photograph modern Burretiodendron specimens.

These are the first representatives of the genera ever recorded from Vietnam, and they are morphologically close to species known in China, Thailand, Myanmar, and Egypt (Fayum). The material recently described from Na Duong is probably misattributed to Bakalovia and likely belongs to Elomeryx. The association in Na Duong of the three new species suggests an early late Eocene to middle late Eocene age for the fossiliferous sediments, which corresponds to a somewhat more precise and restricted time interval than the latest middle to early late Eocene age recently proposed. This also demonstrates that faunal exchanges were possible throughout South Asia and likely between South Asia and Africa during the Eocene period, and it questions the Miocene time of origination of the Na Duong Basin suggested by geological data. http://zoobank.org/urn:lsid:zoobank.org:pub:2E6055C2-CE58-49C7-A227-BD13ABC88495","[Ducrocq, Stephane; Benammi, Mouloud; Chavasseau, Olivier; Chaimanee, Yaowalak; Suraprasit, Kantapon; Jaeger, Jean-Jacques] Univ Poitiers, UMR CNRS 7262, IPHEP, UFR SFA, F-86073 Poitiers 9, France; [Phan Dong Pha; Vu Le Phuong; Phung Van Phach] Vietnam Acad Sci & Technol, Inst Marine Geol & Geophys, Hanoi, Vietnam","Ducrocq, S (corresponding author), Univ Poitiers, UMR CNRS 7262, IPHEP, UFR SFA, Bat 35,6 Rue M Brunet,TSA 51106, F-86073 Poitiers 9, France.",stephane.ducrocq@univ-poitiers.fr; mouloud.benammi@univ-poitiers.fr; olivier.chavasseau@univ-poitiers.fr; yao.chaimanee@univ-poitiers.fr; suraprasit@gmail.com; phandongpha@gmail.com; tigerphuongvu@gmail.com; phachpv@imgg.com.vn; jean-jacques.jaeger@univ-poitiers.fr,,"Chavasseau, Olivier/0000-0001-8638-4583; Suraprasit, Kantapon/0000-0002-3428-9549",CNRS UMRCentre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) [7262]; University of Poitiers;  [ANR-09-BLAN-0238],"We warmly thank Nguyen Thi Viet Anh who efficiently solved all administrative and relationship difficulties with national and local authorities and M.

The enlarged and anteroposteriorly elongated M2 clearly allows us to assign the specimen to Amphicyon as Amphicyon zhanxiangi, sp. nov. The new species is closest to European A. giganteus (e.g., presence of the parastyle and a posteriorly located protocone of P4) and represents an immigrant from Europe during the late early or the earliest middle Miocene. The morphological differences between Amphicyon zhanxiangi, Amphicyon ulungurensis, and North American Amphicyon species suggest at least three dispersal events of the genus from Europe to East Asia during the early and middle Miocene. Amphicyon sp. from the late Miocene site in the Lower Irrawaddy near Magway, Myanmar, shares the enlarged and anteroposteriorly elongated M2 with Amphicyon zhanxiangi and could be a descendant of the latter species.","[Jiangzuo, Qigao; Li, Chunxiao; Wang, Shiqi; Sun, Danhui] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Paleontol & Paleoanthropol, Key Lab Vertebrate Evolut & Human Origins, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [Jiangzuo, Qigao; Li, Chunxiao; Wang, Shiqi; Sun, Danhui] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China; [Jiangzuo, Qigao; Li, Chunxiao; Sun, Danhui] Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China; [Wang, Shiqi] Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Tibetan Plateau Earth Sci, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China","Jiangzuo, QG (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Vertebrate Paleontol & Paleoanthropol, Key Lab Vertebrate Evolut & Human Origins, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China.; Jiangzuo, QG (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Sci, Ctr Excellence Life & Paleoenvironm, Beijing 100044, Peoples R China.; Jiangzuo, QG (corresponding author), Univ Chinese Acad Sci, Beijing 100049, Peoples R China.",jiangzuo@ivpp.ac.cn,,,"Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [XDB26000000]; Key Frontier Science Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [QYZDY-SSW-DQC-22]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [41430102, 41772018]; Special Research Program of Basic Science and Technology of the Ministry of Science and Technology [2015FY310100-14]; Natural Science Foundation of Ningxia [NZ17227]; Sino-Czech Joint Program [CAS-17-06]","The authors thank Z.
